                As a California transplant, seasons are a novelty to me. Temperature
                fluctuations? Sunsets at 4 p.m.? Precipitation?? It’s all somewhat
                bamboozling. Still, I love how seasonal changes bring a rhythm to the year.
                And of all the seasons, autumn has always been my favorite. You can’t not get
                excited for fall when the air gets crisp, the leaves change color, and the PSLs
                start popping up around you like daisies (OK, that’s a vernal metaphor, but you
                get what I mean). To me and to my colleagues at Leff, the chillier weather is a
                chance to slow down from the high energy of summer and gather with families
                and friends. From pumpkin patches and trick-or-treating to canvassing with
                family during election season, my colleagues at Leff shared their favorite cozy
                memories (and some adorable pictures) to get you in the fall spirit.

                Election season brings to mind door-to-door canvassing back in the day,
                supporting our favorite candidate (who also happened to be our dad). This
                photo (of me and my big sister Joan) was taken a number of years before
                we became mortified at the thought of driving around town with a sign on top
                of the car!

                Over the last few years, my cousin and I have met up with our kids at the
                Children’s Farm at The Center in Palos Park, IL. It has all the fall activities one
                could ask for! We usually start with the hay bale climber; move our way over
                to check out all the farm animals (their volunteers are so nice to answer our
                questions and let the kiddos interact with the animals); attempt the corn
                maze; and, of course, pick the best pumpkins from their U-Pick pumpkin
                patch, which is my kids’ favorite. You can also grab some concessions or bring
                a picnic lunch. It’s been a tradition that my kids look forward to every year.

                For many years, I was lucky enough to be able to join my nieces when they
                were still wee enough to want to traipse around the neighborhood in adorable
                costumes. In 2011, Madeline (left) was seven and Sydney was eight, and they
                decided that my Statue of Liberty costume was not complete without a homemade torch. So we got out the construction paper and completed my look.
                After a few hours of collecting candy, we retreated to their mom and dad’s
                house for another treat: takeout from Maggiano’s.

                Aged seven, I (translation: my
                parents) attached leftover strips of
                upholstery fabric to an umbrella to
                create… a jellyfish. By raising and
                lowering the umbrella spokes I could
                make my tentacles pulsate, and,
                as a shy child, I appreciated being
                able to completely hide myself
                underneath it.

                Halloween 1999: I dressed my
                towheaded two-year-old son
                as a “motorcycle dude,” complete
                with a Harley-Davidson jacket
                and slicked-back hair. He went
                trick-or-treating in my in-laws’
                neighborhood, giving the cool dude
                (or the Fonz, for those old enough)
                thumbs-up at every door. Although
                his Halloween costumes became
                more elaborate each year, I’ll always
                treasure this one because it was the
                first Halloween where he understood
                what was going on and had a blast.

                In 2022, our three-year-old insisted
                for months that she wanted to
                dress as a farmer for Halloween.
                Being the supportive parents we are,
                we dressed as a scarecrow and corn.
                It’s now 2023, and this year, our
                now-four-year-old has suggested we
                reprise the theme but swap roles...

                Our Nora (aged 8) dressed as the
                floor of a movie theatre. She wore a
                sandwich board to which we affixed
                carpet strips on both sides. She
                glued popcorn bags, popcorn, candy
                boxes, and drink cups to it. She wore
                an inverted popcorn tub on her head,
                too. It was her idea.
