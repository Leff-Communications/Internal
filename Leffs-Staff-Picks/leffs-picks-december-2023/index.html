                Last Thanksgiving, I strolled through the National Cowboy Museum with my family (yes, non-Americans, we have one, and it’s awesome). Afterward, I found myself with a whetted appetite to learn more about the frontier from the Native American perspective. I seized the opportunity at the annual (and final) Newberry Book Fair this summer and came home with a stack of dusty old books on topics from the Sand Creek Massacre to the self-told story of the Menominee in Wisconsin. Over the following month, I read the entirety of The Portable North American Indian Reader , an anthology from the 1970s that, while a bit dated, contains a ton of great stuff: myths and stories grouped by tribe, speeches from famous Native American leaders, accounts from Hernán Cortés  and Meriwether Lewis, modern (up to the ’70s) essays and poetry from Native thinkers, and more. It was a great starting place to dive deeper into other topics (and the other books sitting atop my To Be Read pile). If you’re like me and curious to learn about Native North American cultures, check out the recommendations from myself and others at Leff for a (more accessible, less esoteric, and more up-to-date) way to celebrate Native American Heritage Month.

                For nearly 20 years, I have been enrolled in The Sister Study, a longitudinal research effort conducted by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. I and more than 53,000 other women across the United States and Puerto Rico who have had a sister with breast cancer have enrolled in this landmark research effort to find causes of breast cancer. Highlights of the research can be found <a href="https://sisterstudy.niehs.nih.gov/English/20th-anniversary-articles.htm" target="_parent">here</a>.

                There’s nothing to say about Doctors Without Borders. The name covers it. Sure, the organization replicates at least some existing global inequities, including sexism and racism. But at least for now, it’s a major source of unbiased (?) humanitarian aid in areas of acute, howling human need. A few dollars should go its way.

                GiveDirectly lets donors send money directly to the world’s poorest households. No donation is too small, and active programs include poverty relief, disaster relief, climate survival, and refugee aid. GiveDirectly believes that people living in poverty deserve the dignity to choose for themselves how best to improve their lives, which is why the organization provides cash. After decades of top-down interventions that have spent billions (or even trillions) of dollars on the poorly targeted provision of services, this approach marks a major step forward in the reduction of extreme poverty—as shown by an ever-growing body of <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/research-at-give-directly/" target="_parent">rigorous research</a>.
