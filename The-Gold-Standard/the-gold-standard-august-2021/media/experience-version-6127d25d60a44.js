this recurring post, I highlight some of the best thought-leadership articles and reports that cross my desk. I note why they rise to the top of the pile and are worth reading (or skimming), even if they focus on functions or industries outside your areas of interest. Among the criteria I use to make the selections are freshness and provocativeness of insights and timeliness, analytical rigor, depth of prescriptions, and overall readability.\n\nAs episodes of extreme weather manifest themselves around the world, professional-services firms are doubling down on their climate change and sustainability offerings, both in terms of client service and thought leadership. Their timing couldn\u2019t be better, given the recent disturbing conclusions of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nFirms such as BCG, Deloitte, and McKinsey expanded their client-service capabilities with the introduction of the BCG Center for Climate and Sustainability, World Climate, and McKinsey Sustainability, respectively. Firms have also published a staggering amount of content on climate change and sustainability since January, exceeded only by their thought leadership on pandemic-related issues such as hybrid working arrangements. They have addressed topics ranging from how individual business sectors can decarbonize to the use of hydrogen as a fuel to reduce carbon emissions to how countries can move to carbon neutrality.\n\nBelow, I highlight some of the strongest work from professional-services firms on climate change and sustainability, with the understanding that there were many other high-quality pieces worth reading. \n

has mounted a strong publishing effort this year on climate change and sustainability. One thought-provoking effort was this piece on business\u2019s stake in biodiversity. \nIt shows how business contributes to biodiversity loss and what it can do to become \u201cbiodiversity-positive.\u201d The authors outline a four-stage approach that would require transformation of the four value chains that account for 90 percent of biodiversity loss: food, infrastructure and mobility, energy, and fashion.\n\n\u201cAs ecosystems decline, business faces significant risks, including higher raw material costs and a backlash from consumers and investors. But the crisis also creates real opportunity. Companies that act to support biodiversity \ncan develop powerful new offerings and business models, improve the attractiveness of existing offerings, and lower operating

Topics range from how energy and \nnatural-resources companies can reinvent themselves in a world facing climate change (the volume\u2019s main piece) to other sustainability challenges to working with ESG investors. Not all the articles directly address the energy transition\u2014some speak to how energy and natural-resources companies can improve their operations. \nBut the impression this package leaves is that Bain has \na sophisticated understanding of the industry and the challenges it faces in dealing with the energy transition.\n\n\u201cThe next five years are going to be critical for the industries that supply energy and natural resources to the world\u2019s economies. In that short span, while they keep their current businesses running, most will begin reinventing themselves as businesses that also move the world closer to a lower-carbon, sustainable future. Some investors are betting against them, shifting money from these incumbents to new companies that have less baggage and appear to be more innovative and more capable of solving the world\u2019s most important issues.

This one stands out.\n\nDon\u2019t be put off by the confusing \u201csystem of systems\u201d terminology. The authors intend the piece to show how addressing climate change will require many players acting \nin concert, rather than one organization focused narrowly \non its own operations.

An electrified vehicle fleet significantly addresses climate change only if it is charged with clean, renewable electricity and manufactured with circular, low-waste processes using sustainably extracted raw materials. It is only by adopting a more comprehensive view of the emerging \nlow-carbon economy that we can begin visualizing the \ncritical connection points and contingencies, in turn allowing organizations to work collaboratively to remove barriers, \nreach critical tipping points, and accelerate adoption of some of the most impactful climate solutions. Isolated initiatives \nmiss the essential synergies in this

compilation of articles took a different approach than most other pieces on climate change. The contributions address how climate-change risks may affect corporate financial statements. Getting out in front of an issue is an important \npart of thought leadership, and the authors do that well here. \nOne could imagine these pieces spurring conversations with chief financial officers of many companies.

For some, these risks may already trigger the immediate need for robust and company-specific disclosures. For others, the impact \nmay not be imminent but will need monitoring in view of the rapidly changing

has been exceptionally active this year in publishing on climate change and sustainability. In this report, cowritten with the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the authors identify 15 high-potential actions that cities can take to address the impact of climate change. The first part of this outstanding report looks at systemic-resilience and hazard-specific actions, including straightforward approaches such as planting street trees, applying cool-surface treatments, and nature-based sustainable drainage methods. Part two explores how cities could carry out these ideas. The report benefits from many examples from cities around the world.\n\n\u201cCities are complex, characterized by a wide variety of natural features, economic endowments, social conditions, institutions, and built environments. They also face different climate risks and have varying levels of vulnerability. Some adaptation options that are effective in most cities may not be feasible in others, given soil conditions, topography, elevation, power composition, age of buildings, and other factors. This complexity means that city leaders have a dizzying array of options for adaptation, making it difficult to set priorities and choose a course of
