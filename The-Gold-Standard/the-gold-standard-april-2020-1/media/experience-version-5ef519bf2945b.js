The crisis is already hitting major social and economic systems, yet black Americans will experience a disproportionate share of the disruption\u2014from morbidity and mortality to unemployment and bankruptcy. \n\nMcKinsey analysis shows that black Americans are almost twice as likely to live in the counties at highest risk of health and economic disruption, if or when the pandemic hits those counties. . . . In addition, we found that 39 percent of all jobs held by black Americans\u2014compared with 34 percent held by white Americans\u2014are now threatened by reductions in hours or pay, temporary furloughs, or permanent layoffs, totaling 7 million jobs.2\n\nIndeed, the pandemic underscores the consequences of the structural disparities that have persisted in this country for centuries while presenting an opportunity to invest in building more equitable systems that will benefit society overall.

consumers are known for the \nspeed at which they adopt new digital technologies. Even before the lockdown, online ordering and payments, had already become the norm in most large cities.\n\nWith the COVID-19 crisis came a new imperative: one that further transformed shopping and buying habits. Pushed by necessity and bringing together innovations that were at various levels of maturity before the lockdown, Chinese retailers and brands brought to life a new way of shopping \nthat can be thought of as Touchless Retail. This means eliminating or making virtual all possible human touchpoints across the end-to-end customer journey from product selection to delivery at the doorstep:\n\n\u2022Search, evaluation and product selection is   completed on a smartphone.\n\u2022The order to payment cycle is also                   completed on smartphone.\n\u2022Human intervention in order fulfillment and     delivery

climate change in a post-pandemic world,\u201d McKinsey & Company\n\nIn this McKinsey Quarterly article, \nMcKinsey consultants explore lessons from the pandemic that could help address \nclimate change.\n\nGiven the scope and magnitude of this sudden crisis, and the long shadow it will cast, can the world afford to pay attention to climate change and the broader sustainability agenda at this time? Our firm belief is that we simply cannot afford to do otherwise. Not only does climate action remain critical over the next decade, but investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and the transition to a lower-carbon future can drive significant near-term job creation while increasing economic and environmental resiliency. And with near-zero interest rates for the foreseeable future, there is no better time than the present for such investments.\n\nTo meet this need and to leverage this opportunity, we believe that leaders would benefit from considering three questions:\n\n\u2022What lessons can be learned from the             current pandemic for climate change?\n\u2022What implications\u2014positive or

following the trajectories of hundreds of companies in our data set since 2014, we find that the overall slow growth in diversity often observed in fact masks a growing polarization among these

While most have made little progress, are stalled or even slipping backward, some are making impressive gains in diversity, particularly in executive teams. We show that these diversity winners are adopting systematic, business-led approaches to inclusion and diversity (I&D). And, with a special focus on inclusion, we highlight the areas where companies should take far bolder action to create a long-lasting inclusive culture and to promote inclusive behavior.\u201d\n\nRead

A practical guide,\u201d Oliver Wyman \n\nThe London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) transition may seem esoteric, but lots of money is at stake. Oliver Wyman, which has followed the issue closely, addresses whether the pandemic will delay the transition.\n\nMarket participants have been preparing for the permanent discontinuation of LIBOR, which industry regulators have indicated could be as early as the end of next year. This is a massive task impacting the entire financial services industry with, according to Oliver Wyman estimates, costs to the industry well over $5 billion dollars. But that was before COVID-19. So, if you\u2019re involved in LIBOR . . . how should the market and your firm \nreact now?\n\n. . . Although regulators have indicated that the industry should stick to the 2021 date, it does seem possible that LIBOR transition may end up being extended by 1 or 2 years. The natural inclination of many will be to freeze their programs and restart at a later time. In our view, that would be a terrible mistake. LIBOR is still a fragile rate, unsecured interbank lending is unlikely to increase in volume, and regulators will still want the industry to be prepared for LIBOR\u2019s end.\n\nBut if there is a

strategy lessons from COVID-19,\u201d BCG Henderson Institute\n\nThe chairman of the BCG Henderson Institute and several other \nco-contributors weigh in on emerging strategy lessons from COVID-19.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has posed a number of severe challenges for businesses, from reacting to the outbreak, preparing for a potential recession, anticipating an eventual rebound in demand and placing bets against the post-crisis landscape. But it also provides an opportunity for organizations to step back and assess their approach to strategy and their strategic capabilities. As the context in which businesses operate becomes more dynamic and unpredictable, driven by the pace of technological change and a high degree of interconnectedness, we should expect other shocks of a similar nature moving forward, whether the trigger comes from biological pathogens, cyberattacks, market crashes, or another sources. Some will be exogenous to the business world, but some will be endogenous.\n\nHow can companies be better prepared for when those shocks occur?

Retail: What the rest of the world could learn from China\u2019s new ways to shop,\u201d Capgemini \n\nCapgemini reports on what retailers can learn from China on new ways to shop.\n\nChinese consumers are known for the speed at which they adopt new digital technologies. Even before the lockdown, online ordering and payments, had already become the norm in most large cities.\nWith the COVID-19 crisis came a new imperative: one that further transformed shopping and buying habits. Pushed by necessity and bringing together innovations that were at various levels of maturity before the lockdown, Chinese retailers and brands brought to life a new way of shopping that can be thought of as Touchless Retail. This means eliminating or making virtual all possible human touchpoints across the end-to-end customer journey from product selection to delivery at the doorstep:\n\n\u2022Search, evaluation and product selection is completed on a               smartphone.\n\u2022The order to payment cycle is also completed on smartphone.\n\u2022Human intervention in order fulfillment and delivery are reduced

Retail: What the rest of the world could learn from China\u2019s new ways to shop,\u201d Capgemini \n\nCapgemini reports on what retailers can learn from China on new ways to shop.\n\nChinese consumers are known for the speed at which they adopt new digital technologies. Even before the lockdown, online ordering and payments, had already become the norm in most large cities.\nWith the COVID-19 crisis came a new imperative: one that further transformed shopping and buying habits. Pushed by necessity and bringing together innovations that were at various levels of maturity before the lockdown, Chinese retailers and brands brought to life a new way of shopping that can be thought of as Touchless Retail. This means eliminating or making virtual all possible human touchpoints across the end-to-end customer journey from product selection to delivery at the doorstep:\n\n\u2022Search, evaluation and product selection is completed on a               smartphone.\n\u2022The order to payment cycle is also completed on smartphone.\n\u2022Human intervention in order fulfillment and delivery are reduced

and the future of work: Four scenarios,\u201d Heidrick & Struggles\n\nAmid the pandemic, Heidrick & Struggles derives four scenarios for the future of human capital in the year 2023.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a historic crisis that is causing leaders and companies to rethink the way they operate. The most effective leaders are thinking not just about their immediate crisis response but also about how their choices now will position their companies in the post-crisis world. But, in a situation changing daily, it\u2019s nearly impossible for any single organization to think that far ahead. By bringing together a range of perspectives, it is possible to sketch out a number of possible futures in 2023 that will allow leaders to incorporate foresight into their business and human capital decisions during the crisis and beyond.\n\nWe\u2019ve turned to scenario planning, a methodology that is focused not on trying to predict the future from past trend lines but on how different uncertainties will combine to form a diverse set of futures, hinged around two high-impact uncertainties: economic rebound and social trust.

and the future of work: Four scenarios,\u201d Heidrick & Struggles\n\nAmid the pandemic, Heidrick & Struggles derives four scenarios for the future of human capital in the year 2023.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a historic crisis that is causing leaders and companies to rethink the way they operate. The most effective leaders are thinking not just about their immediate crisis response but also about how their choices now will position their companies in the post-crisis world. But, in a situation changing daily, it\u2019s nearly impossible for any single organization to think that far ahead. By bringing together a range of perspectives, it is possible to sketch out a number of possible futures in 2023 that will allow leaders to incorporate foresight into their business and human capital decisions during the crisis and beyond.\n\nWe\u2019ve turned to scenario planning, a methodology that is focused not on trying to predict the future from past trend lines but on how different uncertainties will combine to form a diverse set of futures, hinged around two high-impact uncertainties: economic rebound and social trust.

We show that these diversity winners are adopting systematic, business-led approaches to inclusion and diversity (I&D). And, with a special focus on inclusion, we highlight the areas where companies should take far bolder action to create a long-lasting inclusive culture and to promote inclusive

following the trajectories of hundreds of companies in our data set since 2014, we find that the overall slow growth in diversity often observed in fact masks a growing polarization among these organizations. While most have made little progress, are stalled or even slipping backward, some are making impressive gains in diversity, particularly in executive teams. We show that these diversity winners are adopting systematic, business-led approaches to inclusion and diversity (I&D).

this piece published May 27, 2020, Russell Reynolds identifies five lessons emerging from the crisis on D&I: leading inclusively is getting harder, new forms of unconscious bias abound, existing D&I infrastructures must adapt or die, sponsors and allies need to supercharge their efforts, and if you don\u2019t keep D&I on the leadership agenda, it will get lost. \n\n\u201cSome leaders may have diverted their focus away from diversity and inclusion as they grappled with urgent questions around how to manage new economic realities. Yet it is no longer an option to leave these issues unaddressed. If organizations are not actively renewing their commitment to stamping out discrimination, they can expect to see inequities grow deeper and more insidious.\u201d\n\nRead the article","title":"In
