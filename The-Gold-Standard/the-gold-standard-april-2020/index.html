I note why they rise to the top of the pile and are worth reading (or skimming), even if they focus on functions or industries outside your areas of interest. Among the criteria I use to make the selections are freshness and provocativeness of insights and timeliness, analytical rigor, depth of prescriptions, and 
overall readability.

Below, I note some of the more compelling work that professional services firms have published recently on the business, economic, and social implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.

<p class="text-component">“COVID-19: Investing in black lives and livelihoods,” McKinsey & Company

McKinsey consultants discuss why Black Americans are disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Amid the rising deaths, infections, and possible economic implosion of the COVID-19 pandemic, our country’s most pressing need is to save lives and arrest any plunge into a prolonged recession or depression. The crisis is already hitting major social and economic systems, yet black Americans will experience a disproportionate share of the disruption—from morbidity and mortality to unemployment and bankruptcy. 

McKinsey analysis shows that black Americans are almost twice as likely to live in the counties at highest risk of health and economic disruption, if or when the pandemic hits those counties. . . . In addition, we found that 39 percent of all jobs held by black Americans—compared with 34 percent held by white Americans—are now threatened by reductions in hours or pay, temporary furloughs, or permanent layoffs, totaling 7 million jobs.

Indeed, the pandemic underscores the consequences of the structural disparities that have persisted in this country for centuries while presenting an opportunity to invest in building more equitable systems that will benefit society overall. In this article, we outline some of the key findings from our report on COVID-19 and black America.”

<p class="text-component">Chinese consumers are known for the speed at which they adopt new digital technologies. Even before the lockdown, online ordering and payments, had already become the norm in most large cities.
With the COVID-19 crisis came a new imperative: one that further transformed shopping and buying habits. Pushed by necessity and bringing together innovations that were at various levels of maturity before the lockdown, Chinese retailers and brands brought to life a new way of shopping that can be thought of as Touchless Retail. This means eliminating or making virtual all possible human touchpoints across the end-to-end customer journey from product selection to delivery at the doorstep:

•Search, evaluation and product selection is completed on a               smartphone.
•The order to payment cycle is also completed on smartphone.
•Human intervention in order fulfillment and delivery are reduced to     the minimum with the use of robotics and automation.
•Automated drop-off or pick-up stations installed in apartment               buildings or local communities prevent human contact at the point     of receipt.”</p>

<p class="text-component">“Addressing climate change in a post-pandemic world,” 
McKinsey & Company

In this McKinsey Quarterly article, McKinsey consultants explore lessons from the pandemic that could help address climate change.

Given the scope and magnitude of this sudden crisis, and the long shadow it will cast, can the world afford to pay attention to climate change and the broader sustainability agenda at this time? Our firm belief is that we simply cannot afford to do otherwise. Not only does climate action remain critical over the next decade, but investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and the transition to a lower-carbon future can drive significant near-term job creation while increasing economic and environmental resiliency. And with near-zero interest rates for the foreseeable future, there is no better time than the present for such investments.

To meet this need and to leverage this opportunity, we believe that leaders would benefit from considering three questions:

•What lessons can be learned from the current pandemic for               climate change?
•What implications—positive or negative—could our pandemic           responses hold for climate action?

<p class="text-component">The COVID-19 crisis has posed a number of severe challenges for businesses, from reacting to the outbreak, preparing for a potential recession, anticipating an eventual rebound in demand and placing bets against the post-crisis landscape.

<p class="text-component">“What if LIBOR transition is postponed? A practical guide,” Oliver Wyman 

The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) transition may seem esoteric, but lots of money is at stake. Oliver Wyman, which has followed the issue closely, addresses whether the pandemic will delay the transition.

Market participants have been preparing for the permanent discontinuation of LIBOR, which industry regulators have indicated could be as early as the end of next year. This is a massive task impacting the entire financial services industry with, according to Oliver Wyman estimates, costs to the industry well over $5 billion dollars. But that was before COVID-19. So, if you’re involved in LIBOR . . . how should the market and your firm react now?

. . . Although regulators have indicated that the industry should stick to the 2021 date, it does seem possible that LIBOR transition may end up being extended by 1 or 2 years. The natural inclination of many will be to freeze their programs and restart at a later time. In our view, that would be a terrible mistake. LIBOR is still a fragile rate, unsecured interbank lending is unlikely to increase in volume, and regulators will still want the industry to be prepared for LIBOR’s end.

But if there is a delay, the market and firms can use that time to 
their advantage.”

<p class="text-component">The COVID-19 pandemic represents a historic crisis that is causing leaders and companies to rethink the way they operate. The most effective leaders are thinking not just about their immediate crisis response but also about how their choices now will position their companies in the post-crisis world. But, in a situation changing daily, it’s nearly impossible for any single organization to think that far ahead. By bringing together a range of perspectives, it is possible to sketch out a number of possible futures in 2023 that will allow leaders to incorporate foresight into their business and human capital decisions during the crisis and beyond.

We’ve turned to scenario planning, a methodology that is focused not on trying to predict the future from past trend lines but on how different uncertainties will combine to form a diverse set of futures, hinged around two high-impact uncertainties: economic rebound and social trust. Specifically, we have developed macro scenarios for the future of human capital in the year 2023, stemming from the COVID-19 crisis, with implications for companies operating in different industries as well as regions of the world.”</p>

<p class="text-component">“COVID-19: Investing in black lives and livelihoods,” McKinsey & Company

McKinsey consultants discuss why black Americans are disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Amid the rising deaths, infections, and possible economic implosion of the COVID-19 pandemic, our country’s most pressing need is to save lives and arrest any plunge into a prolonged recession or depression. The crisis is already hitting major social and economic systems, yet black Americans will experience a disproportionate share of the disruption—from morbidity and mortality to unemployment and bankruptcy. 

McKinsey analysis shows that black Americans are almost twice as likely to live in the counties at highest risk of health and economic disruption, if or when the pandemic hits those counties. . . . In addition, we found that 39 percent of all jobs held by black Americans—compared with 34 percent held by white Americans—are now threatened by reductions in hours or pay, temporary furloughs, or permanent layoffs, totaling 7 million jobs.2

Indeed, the pandemic underscores the consequences of the structural disparities that have persisted in this country for centuries while presenting an opportunity to invest in building more equitable systems that will benefit society overall. In this article, we outline some of the key findings from our report on COVID-19 and black America.

<p class="text-component">“Touchless Retail: What the rest of the world could learn from China’s new ways to shop,” Capgemini 

Capgemini reports on what retailers can learn from China on new ways to shop.

Chinese consumers are known for the 
speed at which they adopt new digital technologies. Even before the lockdown, online ordering and payments, had already become the norm in most large cities.

With the COVID-19 crisis came a new imperative: one that further transformed shopping and buying habits. Pushed by necessity and bringing together innovations that were at various levels of maturity before the lockdown, Chinese retailers and brands brought to life a new way of shopping 
that can be thought of as Touchless Retail. This means eliminating or making virtual all possible human touchpoints across the end-to-end customer journey from product selection to delivery at the doorstep:

•Search, evaluation and product selection is   completed on a smartphone.
•The order to payment cycle is also                   completed on smartphone.
•Human intervention in order fulfillment and     delivery are reduced to the minimum with       the use of robotics and automation.
•Automated drop-off or pick-up stations           installed in apartment buildings or local           communities prevent human contact at the   point of receipt.

<p class="text-component">“Addressing climate change in a post-pandemic world,” McKinsey & Company

In this McKinsey Quarterly article, 
McKinsey consultants explore lessons from the pandemic that could help address 
climate change.

Given the scope and magnitude of this sudden crisis, and the long shadow it will cast, can the world afford to pay attention to climate change and the broader sustainability agenda at this time? Our firm belief is that we simply cannot afford to do otherwise. Not only does climate action remain critical over the next decade, but investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and the transition to a lower-carbon future can drive significant near-term job creation while increasing economic and environmental resiliency. And with near-zero interest rates for the foreseeable future, there is no better time than the present for such investments.

To meet this need and to leverage this opportunity, we believe that leaders would benefit from considering three questions:

•What lessons can be learned from the             current pandemic for climate change?
•What implications—positive or                           negative—could our pandemic responses       hold for climate action?
•What steps could companies, governments,   and individuals take to align our immediate     pandemic response with the imperatives 
  of sustainability?

<p class="text-component">“Coronavirus: Here’s streaming platforms’ path to lasting customer relationships,” 
Bain & Company

Bain notes that people are watching more video content while confined at home. Are streaming platforms up to the task?

This is a critical moment for streaming platforms for multiple reasons. Due to the coronavirus crisis, households are consuming more content from streaming services. But recent Bain research indicates that by 2024 consumer demand in the US will max out at three to four streaming services per subscribing household.

This implies only a few players will be able to reach meaningful scale over the long term. That means streaming services are under pressure not only to meet customers’ needs during the crisis, but also to take proactive steps now to put their businesses in a stronger position coming out of it. We see three major actions video-streaming services can take to accomplish both goals.
