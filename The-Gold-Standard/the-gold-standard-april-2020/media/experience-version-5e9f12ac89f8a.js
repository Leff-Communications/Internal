strategy lessons from COVID-19,\u201d BCG Henderson Institute\n\nThe chairman of the BCG Henderson Institute and several other co-contributors weigh in on emerging strategy lessons from COVID-19.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has posed a number of severe challenges for businesses, from reacting to the outbreak, preparing for a potential recession, anticipating an eventual rebound in demand and placing bets against the post-crisis landscape. But it also provides an opportunity for organizations to step back and assess their approach to strategy and their strategic capabilities. As the context in which businesses operate becomes more dynamic and unpredictable, driven by the pace of technological change and a high degree of interconnectedness, we should expect other shocks of a similar nature moving forward, whether the trigger comes from biological pathogens, cyberattacks, market crashes, or another sources. Some will be exogenous to the business world, but some will be endogenous.\n\nHow can companies be better prepared \nfor when those shocks occur? We see \n10 strategic lessons emerging from the current crisis.\u201d\n\nRead the article","title":"\u201cEmerging strategy lessons from

Investing in black lives and livelihoods,\u201d McKinsey & Company\n\nMcKinsey consultants discuss why Black Americans are disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAmid the rising deaths, infections, and possible economic implosion of the COVID-19 pandemic, our country\u2019s most pressing need is to save lives and arrest any plunge into a prolonged recession or depression. The crisis is already hitting major social and economic systems, yet black Americans will experience a disproportionate share of the disruption\u2014from morbidity and mortality to unemployment and bankruptcy. \n\nMcKinsey analysis shows that black Americans are almost twice as likely to live in the counties at highest risk of health and economic disruption, if or when the pandemic hits those counties. . . . In addition, we found that 39 percent of all jobs held by black Americans\u2014compared with 34 percent held by white Americans\u2014are now threatened by reductions in hours or pay, temporary furloughs, or permanent layoffs, totaling 7 million jobs.\n\nIndeed, the pandemic underscores the consequences of the structural disparities that have persisted in this country for centuries while presenting an opportunity to invest in building more equitable systems that will benefit society overall.

climate change in a post-pandemic world,\u201d \nMcKinsey & Company\n\nIn this McKinsey Quarterly article, McKinsey consultants explore lessons from the pandemic that could help address climate change.\n\nGiven the scope and magnitude of this sudden crisis, and the long shadow it will cast, can the world afford to pay attention to climate change and the broader sustainability agenda at this time? Our firm belief is that we simply cannot afford to do otherwise. Not only does climate action remain critical over the next decade, but investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and the transition to a lower-carbon future can drive significant near-term job creation while increasing economic and environmental resiliency. And with near-zero interest rates for the foreseeable future, there is no better time than the present for such investments.\n\nTo meet this need and to leverage this opportunity, we believe that leaders would benefit from considering three questions:\n\n\u2022What lessons can be learned from the current pandemic for               climate change?\n\u2022What implications\u2014positive or negative\u2014could our pandemic           responses hold for climate action?\n\u2022What steps could companies, governments, and individuals take       to align our immediate pandemic response with

COVID-19 crisis has posed a number of severe challenges for businesses, from reacting to the outbreak, preparing for a potential recession, anticipating an eventual rebound in demand and placing bets against the post-crisis landscape. But it also provides an opportunity for organizations to step back and assess their approach to strategy and their strategic capabilities. As the context in which businesses operate becomes more dynamic and unpredictable, driven by the pace of technological change and a high degree of interconnectedness, we should expect other shocks of a similar nature moving forward, whether the trigger comes from biological pathogens, cyberattacks, market crashes, or another sources. Some will be exogenous to the business world, but some will be endogenous.\n\nHow can companies be better prepared for when those shocks occur?

A practical guide,\u201d Oliver Wyman \n\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) transition may seem esoteric, but lots of money is at stake. Oliver Wyman, which has followed the issue closely, addresses whether the pandemic will delay the transition.\n\nMarket participants have been preparing for the permanent discontinuation of LIBOR, which industry regulators have indicated could be as early as the end of next year. This is a massive task impacting the entire financial services industry with, according to Oliver Wyman estimates, costs to the industry well over $5 billion dollars. But that was before COVID-19. So, if you\u2019re involved in LIBOR . . . how should the market and your firm react now?\n\n. . . Although regulators have indicated that the industry should stick to the 2021 date, it does seem possible that LIBOR transition may end up being extended by 1 or 2 years. The natural inclination of many will be to freeze their programs and restart at a later time. In our view, that would be a terrible mistake. LIBOR is still a fragile rate, unsecured interbank lending is unlikely to increase in volume, and regulators will still want the industry to be prepared for LIBOR\u2019s end.\n\nBut if there is a

climate change in a post-pandemic world,\u201d McKinsey & Company\n\nIn this McKinsey Quarterly article, McKinsey consultants explore lessons from the pandemic that could help address climate change.\n\nGiven the scope and magnitude of this sudden crisis, and the long shadow it will cast, can the world afford to pay attention to climate change and the broader sustainability agenda at this time? Our firm belief is that we simply cannot afford to do otherwise. Not only does climate action remain critical over the next decade, but investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and the transition to a lower-carbon future can drive significant near-term job creation while increasing economic and environmental resiliency. And with near-zero interest rates for the foreseeable future, there is no better time than the present for such investments.\n\nTo meet this need and to leverage this opportunity, we believe that leaders would benefit from considering three questions:\n\n\u2022What lessons can be learned from the current pandemic for               climate change?\n\u2022What implications\u2014positive or

COVID-19 pandemic represents a historic crisis that is causing leaders and companies to rethink the way they operate. The most effective leaders are thinking not just about their immediate crisis response but also about how their choices now will position their companies in the post-crisis world. But, in a situation changing daily, it\u2019s nearly impossible for any single organization to think that far ahead. By bringing together a range of perspectives, it is possible to sketch out a number of possible futures in 2023 that will allow leaders to incorporate foresight into their business and human capital decisions during the crisis and beyond.\n\nWe\u2019ve turned to scenario planning, a methodology that is focused not on trying to predict the future from past trend lines but on how different uncertainties will combine to form a diverse set of futures, hinged around two high-impact uncertainties: economic rebound and social trust.

strategy lessons from covid-19,\u201d BCG Henderson Institute\n\nThe chairman of the BCG Henderson Institute and several other co-contributors weigh in on emerging strategy lessons from COVID-19.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has posed a number of severe challenges for businesses, from reacting to the outbreak, preparing for a potential recession, anticipating an eventual rebound in demand and placing bets against the post-crisis landscape. But it also provides an opportunity for organizations to step back and assess their approach to strategy and their strategic capabilities. As the context in which businesses operate becomes more dynamic and unpredictable, driven by the pace of technological change and a high degree of interconnectedness, we should expect other shocks of a similar nature moving forward, whether the trigger comes from biological pathogens, cyberattacks, market crashes, or another sources. Some will be exogenous to the business world, but some will be endogenous.\n\nHow can companies be better prepared \nfor when those shocks occur?

deaths, infections, and possible economic implosion of the COVID-19 pandemic, our country\u2019s most pressing need is to save lives and arrest any plunge into a prolonged recession or depression. The crisis is already hitting major social and economic systems, yet black Americans will experience a disproportionate share of the disruption\u2014from morbidity and mortality to unemployment and bankruptcy. \n\nMcKinsey analysis shows that black Americans are almost twice as likely to live in the counties at highest risk of health and economic disruption, if or when the pandemic hits those counties. . . . In addition, we found that 39 percent of all jobs held by black Americans\u2014compared with 34 percent held by white Americans\u2014are now threatened by reductions in hours or pay, temporary furloughs, or permanent layoffs, totaling 7 million jobs.\n\nIndeed, the pandemic underscores the consequences of the structural disparities that have persisted in this country for centuries while presenting an opportunity to invest in building more equitable systems that will benefit society overall. In this article, we outline some of the key findings from our report on COVID-19 and black America.\u201d\n\nRead the article or the full report upon which it is based","title":"\u201cCOVID-19:

deaths, infections, and possible economic implosion of the COVID-19 pandemic, our country\u2019s most pressing need is to save lives and arrest any plunge into a prolonged recession or depression. The crisis is already hitting major social and economic systems, yet black Americans will experience a disproportionate share of the disruption\u2014from morbidity and mortality to unemployment and bankruptcy. \n\nMcKinsey analysis shows that black Americans are almost twice as likely to live in the counties at highest risk of health and economic disruption, if or when the pandemic hits those counties. . . . In addition, we found that 39 percent of all jobs held by black Americans\u2014compared with 34 percent held by white Americans\u2014are now threatened by reductions in hours or pay, temporary furloughs, or permanent layoffs, totaling 7 million jobs.2\n\nIndeed, the pandemic underscores the consequences of the structural disparities that have persisted in this country for centuries while presenting an opportunity to invest in building more equitable systems that will benefit society overall.

Retail: What the rest of the world could learn from China\u2019s new ways to shop,\u201d Capgemini \n\nCapgemini reports on what retailers can learn from China on new ways to shop.\n\nChinese consumers are known for the \nspeed at which they adopt new digital technologies. Even before the lockdown, online ordering and payments, had already become the norm in most large cities.\n\nWith the COVID-19 crisis came a new imperative: one that further transformed shopping and buying habits. Pushed by necessity and bringing together innovations that were at various levels of maturity before the lockdown, Chinese retailers and brands brought to life a new way of shopping \nthat can be thought of as Touchless Retail. This means eliminating or making virtual all possible human touchpoints across the end-to-end customer journey from product selection to delivery at the doorstep:\n\n\u2022Search, evaluation and product selection is   completed on a smartphone.\n\u2022The order to payment cycle is also                   completed on smartphone.\n\u2022Human intervention in order fulfillment and     delivery are reduced to the minimum with       the use of robotics and automation.\n\u2022Automated drop-off or pick-up stations           installed in apartment buildings or local           communities prevent human contact at the   point of receipt.\u201d\n\nRead the article","title":"\u201cTouchless Retail: What the rest of the

Retail: What the rest of the world could learn from China\u2019s new ways to shop,\u201d Capgemini \n\nCapgemini reports on what retailers can learn from China on new ways to shop.\n\nChinese consumers are known for the \nspeed at which they adopt new digital technologies. Even before the lockdown, online ordering and payments, had already become the norm in most large cities.\n\nWith the COVID-19 crisis came a new imperative: one that further transformed shopping and buying habits. Pushed by necessity and bringing together innovations that were at various levels of maturity before the lockdown, Chinese retailers and brands brought to life a new way of shopping \nthat can be thought of as Touchless Retail. This means eliminating or making virtual all possible human touchpoints across the end-to-end customer journey from product selection to delivery at the doorstep:\n\n\u2022Search, evaluation and product selection is   completed on a smartphone.\n\u2022The order to payment cycle is also                   completed on smartphone.\n\u2022Human intervention in order fulfillment and     delivery are reduced to the minimum with       the use of robotics and automation.\n\u2022Automated drop-off or pick-up stations           installed in apartment buildings or local           communities

climate change in a post-pandemic world,\u201d McKinsey & Company\n\nIn this McKinsey Quarterly article, \nMcKinsey consultants explore lessons from the pandemic that could help address \nclimate change.\n\nGiven the scope and magnitude of this sudden crisis, and the long shadow it will cast, can the world afford to pay attention to climate change and the broader sustainability agenda at this time? Our firm belief is that we simply cannot afford to do otherwise. Not only does climate action remain critical over the next decade, but investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and the transition to a lower-carbon future can drive significant near-term job creation while increasing economic and environmental resiliency. And with near-zero interest rates for the foreseeable future, there is no better time than the present for such investments.\u201d\n\nTo meet this need and to leverage this opportunity, we believe that leaders would benefit from considering three questions:\n\n\u2022What lessons can be learned from the             current pandemic for climate change?\n\u2022What implications\u2014positive or                           negative\u2014could our pandemic responses       hold for climate action?\n\u2022What steps could companies, governments,   and individuals take to align our immediate     pandemic response with the imperatives \n  of sustainability?\n\nRead the article","title":"\u201cAddressing climate change in a

climate change in a post-pandemic world,\u201d McKinsey & Company\n\nIn this McKinsey Quarterly article, \nMcKinsey consultants explore lessons from the pandemic that could help address \nclimate change.\n\nGiven the scope and magnitude of this sudden crisis, and the long shadow it will cast, can the world afford to pay attention to climate change and the broader sustainability agenda at this time? Our firm belief is that we simply cannot afford to do otherwise. Not only does climate action remain critical over the next decade, but investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and the transition to a lower-carbon future can drive significant near-term job creation while increasing economic and environmental resiliency. And with near-zero interest rates for the foreseeable future, there is no better time than the present for such investments.\n\nTo meet this need and to leverage this opportunity, we believe that leaders would benefit from considering three questions:\n\n\u2022What lessons can be learned from the             current pandemic for climate change?\n\u2022What implications\u2014positive or                           negative\u2014could our pandemic responses       hold for climate action?\n\u2022What steps could companies, governments,   and individuals take to align our immediate     pandemic

Here\u2019s streaming platforms\u2019 path to lasting customer relationships,\u201d \nBain & Company\n\nBain notes that people are watching more video content while confined at home. Are streaming platforms up to the task?\n\nThis is a critical moment for streaming platforms for multiple reasons. Due to the coronavirus crisis, households are consuming more content from streaming services. But recent Bain research indicates that by 2024 consumer demand in the US will max out at three to four streaming services per subscribing household.\n\nThis implies only a few players will be able to reach meaningful scale over the long term. That means streaming services are under pressure not only to meet customers\u2019 needs during the crisis, but also to take proactive steps now to put their businesses in a stronger position coming out of it. We see three major actions video-streaming services can take to accomplish both goals.\u201d\n\nRead the article","title":"\u201cCoronavirus: Here\u2019s streaming

if LIBOR transition is postponed? A practical guide,\u201d Oliver Wyman \n\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) transition may seem esoteric, but lots of money is at stake. Oliver Wyman, which has followed the issue closely, addresses whether the pandemic will delay the transition.\n\nMarket participants have been preparing for the permanent discontinuation of LIBOR, which industry regulators have indicated could be as early as the end of next year. This is a massive task impacting the entire financial services industry with, according to Oliver Wyman estimates, costs to the industry well over $5 billion dollars. But that was before COVID-19. So, if you\u2019re involved in LIBOR . . . how should the market and your firm \nreact now?\n\n. . . Although regulators have indicated that the industry should stick to the 2021 date, it does seem possible that LIBOR transition may end up being extended by 1 or 2 years.

A practical guide,\u201d Oliver Wyman \n\nThe London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) transition may seem esoteric, but lots of money is at stake. Oliver Wyman, which has followed the issue closely, addresses whether the pandemic will delay the transition.\n\nMarket participants have been preparing for the permanent discontinuation of LIBOR, which industry regulators have indicated could be as early as the end of next year. This is a massive task impacting the entire financial services industry with, according to Oliver Wyman estimates, costs to the industry well over $5 billion dollars. But that was before COVID-19. So, if you\u2019re involved in LIBOR . . . how should the market and your firm \nreact now?\n\n. . . Although regulators have indicated that the industry should stick to the 2021 date, it does seem possible that LIBOR transition may end up being extended by 1 or 2 years. The natural inclination of many will be to freeze their programs and restart at a later time. In our view, that would be a terrible mistake. LIBOR is still a fragile rate, unsecured interbank lending is unlikely to increase in volume, and regulators will still want the industry to be prepared for LIBOR\u2019s end.\n\nBut if there is a

and the future of work: Four scenarios,\u201d Heidrick & Struggles\n\nAmid the pandemic, Heidrick & Struggles derives four scenarios for the future of human capital in the year 2023.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a historic crisis that is causing leaders and companies to rethink the way they operate. The most effective leaders are thinking not just about their immediate crisis response but also about how their choices now will position their companies in the post-crisis world. But, in a situation changing daily, it\u2019s nearly impossible for any single organization to think that far ahead. By bringing together a range of perspectives, it is possible to sketch out a number of possible futures in 2023 that will allow leaders to incorporate foresight into their business and human capital decisions during the crisis and beyond.\n\nWe\u2019ve turned to scenario planning, a methodology that is focused not on trying to predict the future from past trend lines but on how different uncertainties will combine to form a diverse set of futures, hinged around two high-impact uncertainties: economic rebound and social trust. Specifically, we have developed macro scenarios for the future of human capital in the year 2023, stemming from the COVID-19 crisis, with implications for companies operating in different industries as well as regions of \nthe world.\u201d\n\nRead the article","title":"\u201cCOVID-19 and the future of work: Four

strategy lessons from COVID-19,\u201d BCG Henderson Institute\n\nThe chairman of the BCG Henderson Institute and several other \nco-contributors weigh in on emerging strategy lessons from COVID-19.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has posed a number of severe challenges for businesses, from reacting to the outbreak, preparing for a potential recession, anticipating an eventual rebound in demand and placing bets against the post-crisis landscape. But it also provides an opportunity for organizations to step back and assess their approach to strategy and their strategic capabilities. As the context in which businesses operate becomes more dynamic and unpredictable, driven by the pace of technological change and a high degree of interconnectedness, we should expect other shocks of a similar nature moving forward, whether the trigger comes from biological pathogens, cyberattacks, market crashes, or another sources. Some will be exogenous to the business world, but some will be endogenous.\n\nHow can companies be better prepared for when those shocks occur?

consumers are known for the speed at which they adopt new digital technologies. Even before the lockdown, online ordering and payments, had already become the norm in most large cities.\nWith the COVID-19 crisis came a new imperative: one that further transformed shopping and buying habits. Pushed by necessity and bringing together innovations that were at various levels of maturity before the lockdown, Chinese retailers and brands brought to life a new way of shopping that can be thought of as Touchless Retail. This means eliminating or making virtual all possible human touchpoints across the end-to-end customer journey from product selection to delivery at the doorstep:\n\n\u2022Search, evaluation and product selection is completed on a               smartphone.\n\u2022The order to payment cycle is also completed on smartphone.\n\u2022Human intervention in order fulfillment and delivery are reduced to     the minimum with the use of robotics and automation.\n\u2022Automated drop-off or pick-up stations installed in apartment               buildings or local communities prevent human contact at

Retail: What the rest of the world could learn from China\u2019s new ways to shop,\u201d Capgemini \n\nCapgemini reports on what retailers can learn from China on new ways to shop.\n\nChinese consumers are known for the speed at which they adopt new digital technologies. Even before the lockdown, online ordering and payments, had already become the norm in most large cities.\nWith the COVID-19 crisis came a new imperative: one that further transformed shopping and buying habits. Pushed by necessity and bringing together innovations that were at various levels of maturity before the lockdown, Chinese retailers and brands brought to life a new way of shopping that can be thought of as Touchless Retail. This means eliminating or making virtual all possible human touchpoints across the end-to-end customer journey from product selection to delivery at the doorstep:\n\n\u2022Search, evaluation and product selection is completed on a               smartphone.\n\u2022The order to payment cycle is also completed on smartphone.\n\u2022Human intervention in order fulfillment and delivery are reduced

and the future of work: Four scenarios,\u201d Heidrick & Struggles\n\nAmid the pandemic, Heidrick & Struggles derives four scenarios for the future of human capital in the year 2023.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a historic crisis that is causing leaders and companies to rethink the way they operate. The most effective leaders are thinking not just about their immediate crisis response but also about how their choices now will position their companies in the post-crisis world. But, in a situation changing daily, it\u2019s nearly impossible for any single organization to think that far ahead. By bringing together a range of perspectives, it is possible to sketch out a number of possible futures in 2023 that will allow leaders to incorporate foresight into their business and human capital decisions during the crisis and beyond.\n\nWe\u2019ve turned to scenario planning, a methodology that is focused not on trying to predict the future from past trend lines but on how different uncertainties will combine to form a diverse set of futures, hinged around two high-impact uncertainties: economic rebound and social trust. Specifically, we have developed macro scenarios for the future of human capital in the year 2023, stemming from the COVID-19 crisis, with implications for companies operating in different industries

and the future of work: Four scenarios,\u201d Heidrick & Struggles\n\nAmid the pandemic, Heidrick & Struggles derives four scenarios for the future of human capital in the year 2023.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a historic crisis that is causing leaders and companies to rethink the way they operate. The most effective leaders are thinking not just about their immediate crisis response but also about how their choices now will position their companies in the post-crisis world. But, in a situation changing daily, it\u2019s nearly impossible for any single organization to think that far ahead. By bringing together a range of perspectives, it is possible to sketch out a number of possible futures in 2023 that will allow leaders to incorporate foresight into their business and human capital decisions during the crisis and beyond.\n\nWe\u2019ve turned to scenario planning, a methodology that is focused not on trying to predict the future from past trend lines but on how different uncertainties will combine to form a diverse set of futures, hinged around two high-impact uncertainties: economic rebound and social trust.
