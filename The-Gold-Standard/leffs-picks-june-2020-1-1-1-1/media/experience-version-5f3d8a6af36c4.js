Succeeding in this uncertain period requires using two gears, moving together, in a maturing cycle of modelling, iterating and pivoting. While Gear 1 focuses on a trusted transition back to physical operations, Gear 2 explores how to transform for the better. Gear 1 focuses on risks; Gear 2 breaks open opportunities. Yet they are interconnected and interdependent, meaning a poorly executed transition will block the path to transformation.\u201d","textSpans":[{"fontColor":"#FFFFFF","index":0,"length":705,"variantGuid":"Uploaded|d596a23d-3d30-11e8-88f3-0e55d9bc9e68"}],"defaultSpan":{"fontColor":"rgb(0,0,0)","fontSize":23,"variantGuid":"Uploaded|d5969f30-3d30-11e8-88f3-0e55d9bc9e68","underline":false,"letterSpacing":0},"indent":0,"justify":"left","columns":1,"columnGap":0,"leading":32,"textShadow":[],"autoLeading":false,"textTransform":"none","paddingTop":0,"paddingBottom":0,"paddingRight":0,"paddingLeft":0,"showOverflow":true,"glyphMetrics":"[0,0,9.66,,23.46,,38.18,,48.3,,63.02,,69.46,,84.64,,98.44,,105.34,,119.14,,133.86,,141.22,,151.34,,157.78,,172.96,,178.48,,188.6,,203.32,,209.76,,216.66,,231.84,,244.49,,259.21,,265.65,,280.83,,287.27,,302.45,,317.17,,323.61,,338.33,,345.07,,359.79,,369.45,,384.63,,398.43,,413.61,,423.27,,438.45,,444.89,,451.79,,466.51,,473.87,,480.31,,495.49,,510.67,,525.85,,532.59,,547.31,,562.49,,577.21,,591.01,,0,32,6.9,,21.62,,28.06,,34.96,,48.76,,63.48,,69.92,,88.32,,103.04,,110.4,,123.74,,138.92,,144.44,,159.62,,174.34,,189.06,,195.5,,201.94,,211.6,,225.4,,240.12,,253.46,,259.9,,275.08,,290.26,,303.14,,308.66,,318.78,,333.5,,339.94,,354.66,,368.46,,374.9,,388.7,,403.42,,421.82,,428.26,,435.16,,449.88,,456.32,,463.06,,477.78,,484.68,,498.48,,505.95,,519.75,,526.19,,533.09,,547.81,,0,64,18.4,,33.12,,40.48,,53.82,,60.26,,75.44,,89.24,,104.42,,110.86,,117.76,,131.56,,146.28,,160.08,,166.52,,180.32,,195.04,,213.44,,219.88,,226.78,,241.5,,247.94,,263.12,,278.3,,284.28,,298.08,,308.2,,315.1,,321.54,,327.98,,342.7,,350.06,,356.5,,363.4,,377.2,,391.92,,398.36,,403.88,,418.6,,432.4,,447.58,,454.02,,460.92,,475.64,,483.12,,504.74,,511.18,,0,96,0,128,11.04,,28.06,,38.18,,44.62,,63.02,,77.74,,84.18,,99.36,,114.08,,129.26,,134.78,,148.58,,155.02,,161.92,,176.64,,183.08,,197.8,,219.42,,234.14,,240.88,,256.06,,270.78,,277.22,,291.94,,305.74,,312.64,,319.08,,333.8,,340.24,,346.68,,352.2,,366.92,,381.64,,394.29,,409.47,,424.19,,442.59,,456.39,,462.83,,469.27,,474.79,,489.51,,504.69,,519.87,,534.59,,541.95,,552.07,,0,160,21.62,,35.42,,45.54,,52.44,,58.88,,65.62,,80.34,,87.24,,101.04,,106.56,,120.36,,133.7,,140.14,,147.04,,160.84,,175.56,,182,,196.72,,210.52,,223.4,,228.92,,235.66,,250.38,,264.18,,285.8,,300.52,,314.32,,321.22,,327.66,,333.18,,346.98,,353.42,,371.82,,385.62,,391.14,,405.86,,419.66,,426.1,,433,,446.8,,461.52,,467.04,,474.4,,0,192,14.72,,29.44,,51.06,,66.24,,81.42,,95.22,,100.74,,115.46,,125.58,,132.02,,146.74,,161.92,,176.64,,183.38,,198.56,,205.46,,220.18,,226.62,,233.06,,245.02,,258.82,,273.54,,288.26,,302.98,,317.7,,332.88,,338.4,,352.2,,367.38,,373.82,,379.34,,393.14,,399.58,,406.48,,420.28,,425.8,,435.92,,442.36,,456.16,,469.96,,484.68,,499.4,,507.22,,514.12,,529.3,,534.82,,548.62,,0,224,15.18,,29.9,,37.26,,42.78,,57.5,,72.68,,79.12,,85.86,,100.58,,115.76,,129.56,,135.08,,141.82,,156.54,,166.66,,173.1,,186.9,,197.02,,202.54,,216.34,,231.52,,237.96,,244.86,,263.26,,277.98,,284.42,,299.6,,314.32,,329.5,,336.86,,346.98,,353.42,,359.86,,381.48,,396.2,,409.08,,414.6,,428.4,,443.58,,450.02,,456.92,,471.64,,486.82,,501.54,,508.44,,522.24,,536.96,,544.52,,550.97,,557.41,,562.93,,576.73,,583.17,,598.35,,0,256,21.62,,36.8,,43.7,,57.5,,64.86,,70.38,,84.18,,99.36,,105.8,,120.52,,133.86,,148.58,,154.1,,168.82,,175.26,,189.98,,196.42,,202.86,,224.48,,239.2,,254.38,,269.1,,274.62,,280.14,,285.66,,299.46,,314.64,,321.08,,327.52,,333.04,,339.94,,354.66,,361.4,,376.58,,383.48,,389,,402.8,,417.98,,424.42,,439.6,,453.4,,468.58,,475.02,,490.2,,495.72,,508.6,,523.32,,530.22,,535.74,,549.54,,564.72,,571.16,,0,288,20.7,,34.5,,40.02,,45.54,,60.26,,66.7,,86.02,,100.74,,115.92,,123.28,,129.72,,142.6,,149.04,,155.48,,170.2,,184.92,,198.72,,208.84,,223.56,,233.68,,240.12,,254.84,,268.64,,275.08,,290.26,,296.7,,303.6,,311.42,,325.22,,335.34,,342.24,,356.96,,372.14,,378.58,,385.48,,392.22,,407.4,,421.2,,431.32,,436.84,,443.74,,449.26,,463.98,,477.78,,484.22,,499.4,,514.58,,529.3,,542.64,,549.08,,555.98,,570.7,,0,320,15.18,,28.98,,42.32,,52.44,,57.96,,72.68,,87.86,,93.38,,99.82,,114.54,,129.72,,144.44,,151.18,,166.36,,173.26,,178.78,,193.5,,207.3,,217.42,,223.86,,230.3,,249.62,,264.34,,279.52,,286.88,,293.32,,306.2,,312.64,,327.36,,340.24,,355.42,,360.94,,375.66,,382.4,,397.12,,407.24,,413.68,,427.48,,442.2,,460.6,,467.04,,473.94,,488.66,,495.1,,502,,508.74,,523.92,,537.72,,547.84,,554.28,,569,,576.47,,598.09,,0,352,6.44,,21.16,,28.52,,34.96,,41.86,,55.66,,70.38,,76.82,,92,,106.72,,113.62,,120.52,,135.24,,142.81,,149.25,,155.69,,175.01,,189.73,,204.91,,212.27,,218.71,,231.59,,238.03,,244.47,,259.19,,273.91,,287.71,,297.83,,312.55,,322.67,,329.11,,343.83,,357.63,,364.07,,371.43,,376.95,,387.07,,400.41,,410.53,,416.97,,423.41,,442.73,,457.45,,472.63,,479.99,,486.43,,499.31,,505.75,,520.93,,527.67,,542.39,,557.57,,570.91,,581.03,,0,384,14.72,,29.9,,44.62,,58.42,,64.86,,79.58,,94.76,,109.94,,124.66,,132.48,,139.38,,153.18,,166.98,,172.5,,179.4,,184.92,,199.64,,209.76,,216.2,,222.64,,234.6,,249.32,,256.22,,262.66,,269.56,,283.36,,298.0

Regardless of your industry, size or where you are in the development of your plans, however, a first and fundamental step toward implementation of your plans is conducting a risk review. One efficient mechanism for performing the risk review, creating the framework, and helping you make key strategic and regulatory decisions in a focused and stepwise approach, is to answer a series of detailed questions addressing the following topics: employee testing, environmental and facility controls, human resources policies, administrative controls, and medical monitoring and

to the authors for weighing in on this timely, \nyet not obvious, topic. The piece contains lots of interesting insights on workforce inclusion that could benefit leaders of all kinds of organizations in this difficult moment.\n\n\u201cPeople are now connecting in entirely different ways, often experiencing greater connectivity than they did before the pandemic. However, this environment does not guarantee greater inclusion at work. Without targeted intervention, noninclusive dynamics among on-site teams have the potential to be amplified in a remote context. For example, the habit of interacting primarily with familiar team members versus building new connections, supporters, and champions may be even harder to overcome when impromptu, in-person interactions are no longer possible. This dynamic is especially true for employees who already felt like an \u2018only\u2019 on their

Meanwhile, other employees will want to socialize with team members and feel that they are part of the organization.
