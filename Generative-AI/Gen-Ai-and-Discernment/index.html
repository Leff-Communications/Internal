        “I think there’s an assumption that copy editing is rote work,” Morgan Strunsky said.
    </p>
    <p>
        Morgan is a senior editorial associate at Leff, which means he spends his working hours copy editing: scrubbing sentences for clarity, consistency, and adherence to clients’ preferred style.
    </p>
    <p>
        The topic of rote work came up because—well, look at the news. Generative AI is poised to change the world, and it’s coming for relatively rote white-collar tasks first. So they say.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Leff team decided to test generative AI’s abilities as a copy editor. Morgan valiantly volunteered to go toe to nonexistent toe with ChatGPT in copy editing two passages from different nonfiction texts:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <em>The Bottom Billion</em>, by Paul Collier
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>The Big Short</em>, by Michael Lewis
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The passages in the published works have obviously already been copy edited, so I mussed them up by inserting some awkwardness. I gave those messier passages to both Morgan and ChatGPT to copy edit and gave them the same instructions. Below, we share both copyedited versions of the two passages and the published versions of the passages, plus color commentary.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our experiment revealed—rather, confirmed—that copy editing is not rote. Not in an environment in which everyone knows what good looks like. ChatGPT’s individual sentences were grammatically correct, but at the paragraph level, the passages made for slow, unengaging reading, mostly because the sentences tended to be of similar lengths and cadences. It made for the reading equivalent of listening to someone speak in a monotone. What’s more, ChatGPT misunderstood an assertion from one of the passages.
    </p>
    <p>
        While this post is nominally about copy editing, it’s also our attempt to experience the benefits and limitations of generative AI when it comes to tasks that require discernment and judgment.

        Now, on to the experiment.

    <h2>Passage about the role of aid in regimes vulnerable to coups: Turning an exciting topic into boring copy</h2>
    <div>
        <p><strong>Source:</strong> <em>The Bottom Billion</em>, by Paul Collier</p>
        <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Copy edit the passage below for a general business audience, similar to the audience of <em>The Economist.</em></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 50px;">
            <p>
                Aid can be an inducement to rebellion and coups because capturing the state becomes more valuable.
            </p>
            <p>
                In some societies, aid is often the key part of the rents to sovereignty. Aid can make things worse, but it's hard to tell because it's impractical to study
