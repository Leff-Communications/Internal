        <h1>WROTE<br>WORK:</h1>
        <h2>CAN GENERATIVE<br>AI BEAT A LEFF<br>COPY EDITOR?</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        “I think there’s an assumption that copy editing is rote work,” Morgan Strunsky said.
    </p>
    <p>
        Morgan is a senior editorial associate at Leff, which means he spends his working hours copy editing: scrubbing sentences for clarity, consistency, and adherence to clients’ preferred style.
    </p>
    <p>
        The topic of rote work came up because—well, look at the news. Generative AI is poised to change the world, and it’s coming for relatively rote white-collar tasks first. So they say.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Leff team decided to test generative AI’s abilities as a copy editor. Morgan valiantly volunteered to go toe to nonexistent toe with ChatGPT in copy editing two passages from different nonfiction texts:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <em>The Bottom Billion</em>, by Paul Collier
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>The Big Short</em>, by Michael Lewis
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The passages in the published works have obviously already been copy edited, so I mussed them up by inserting some awkwardness. I gave those messier passages to both Morgan and ChatGPT to copy edit and gave them the same instructions. Below, we share both copyedited versions of the two passages and the published versions of the passages, plus color commentary.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our experiment revealed—rather, confirmed—that copy editing is not rote. Not in an environment in which everyone knows what good looks like. ChatGPT’s individual sentences were grammatically correct, but at the paragraph level, the passages made for slow, unengaging reading, mostly because the sentences tended to be of similar lengths and cadences. It made for the reading equivalent of listening to someone speak in a monotone. What’s more, ChatGPT misunderstood an assertion from one of the passages.
    </p>
    <p>
        While this post is nominally about copy editing, it’s also our attempt to experience the benefits and limitations of generative AI when it comes to tasks that require discernment and judgment.

        Now, on to the experiment.

                Aid can be an inducement to rebellion and coups because capturing the state becomes more valuable.

            <p>

        <p>
            In some societies, aid is often a key part of payments made to
            those in power, thereby inducing rebellions and coups because
            capturing the state becomes more valuable. This implies that aid can
            actually make the situation worse, though such a claim is hard to
            verify because studying or surveying rebels and leaders of coups is
            obviously impractical.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Morgan:</b> To start, I reordered the sentences and added transitions to better frame the logical
            argument. Then I changed the phrase “an inducement to” because it’s unnecessary to turn
            the verb into a noun phrase when the verb itself would do fine. Finally, I leaned into the final
            sentence’s point that gauging the validity of the claim is difficult because, obviously, one
            can’t simply interview the leader of a coup.
        </p>

        <p>
            I removed the term “rents to sovereignty” because, without context, it’s an unhelpful term.
            “Rents to sovereignty” is such a niche term and so integral to the meaning of the passage
            that without context, it’s nearly impossible to know what the passage is trying to say. This
            is an example of when I would touch base with the author to clarify the language—or else I
            would research the unfamiliar term.
        </p>

        <p>
            In fact, in editing this passage, I did search for the phrase “rents to sovereignty.” In my edit,
            I rephrased the sentence to cut out the phrase because if it’s so niche that a reader has to
            hunt for what it means, then it’s too narrow a term. So ultimately, I would take advantage
            of my ability to discuss a passage with the author to inform the edit—something that AI
            can’t do.

            Foreign aid has the potential to incentivize rebellions and coups
            by increasing the value of seizing control of the government. In
            certain societies, aid forms a crucial component of the benefits
            associated with sovereignty. However, the impact of aid on such
            situations is difficult to ascertain due to the impracticality of studying
            or surveying rebels and coup leaders. This poses a challenge in
            understanding the full ramifications of aid involvement.

        Can aid actually make things worse? Some researchers think so: aid
        may be an inducement to rebellion and to coups because capturing
        the state becomes more valuable. In the societies of the bottom billion,
        aid is probably the key part of what is sometimes called the “rents to
        sovereignty”—the payoff to power. So is big aid an incentive to rebellion
        or to coups? How do you tell—conduct a survey of rebels and coup
        leaders?

    <p class="accent">Passage about the bond market and derivatives</p>
    <div>
        <p><strong>Source:</strong> <em>The Big Short</em>, by Michael Lewis</p>
        <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Copy edit the passage below for a
            general business audience, similar to the readers of a
            business story in the <em>New York Times Magazine.</em></p>
        <div style="margin-left: 50px;">
            <p>
                With mostly big institutional investors, the
                bond market saw no populist political pressure like what the stock
                market saw. Even though it grew larger than the stock market, the
                bond market did not receive significant regulatory pressure.
                As a result, bond salesmen could say and do anything without
                fear of regulatory sanctions, including if they used inside
                information. Bond technicians could also create increasingly
                complicated securities without worrying about regulatory
                consequences. It’s one reason so many derivatives were
                derived from bonds.

            Consisting mostly of big institutional investors, the bond market
            faced no populist political pressure like that experienced by the
            stock market. It was also free of significant regulatory pressure,
            despite growing larger than its counterpart. As a result, bond
            salespeople could say and do anything without fear of regulatory
            sanctions—including using inside information and creating
            increasingly complicated securities. This is one reason why so many
            derivatives were developed from bonds.

            <b>Morgan:</b> I began by combining several redundant phrases both to cut down on word
            repetition and to vary the sentence length. Next, I included transition words to chain
            the ideas together. I also replaced the gendered term “salesman.” Last, I varied the
            punctuation for better flow between sentences.

            In contrast to the stock market, the bond market, dominated by
            major institutional investors, remained shielded from the populist
            political pressures. Despite its substantial growth surpassing that
            of the stock market, the bond market evaded significant regulatory
            scrutiny. Consequently, bond salespeople enjoyed a relatively
            unrestricted environment where they could make claims and take
            actions without fear of regulatory consequences, even when utilizing
            insider information. Additionally, bond experts were able to develop
            increasingly intricate securities without concerns about regulatory
            repercussions. This circumstance partly explains the proliferation of
            derivatives derived from bonds.

            The bond market, because
            it consisted mainly of big
            institutional investors,
            experienced no similarly
            populist political pressure.
            Even as it came to dwarf the
            stock market, the bond market
            eluded serious regulation.
            Bond salesmen could say
            and do anything without
            fear that they’d be reported
            to some authority. Bond
            traders could exploit inside
            information without worrying
            that they would be caught.
            Bond technicians could dream
            up even more complicated
            securities without worrying
            too much about government
            regulation—one reason why
            so many derivatives had been
            derived one way or another,
            from bonds.

        <p>
            <b>Morgan:</b> I like the published version of this passage. Its use of alliteration
            (“populist political pressure”) and rhetorical repetition (“Bond
            salesman”; “Bond traders”; “Bond technicians”) make it interesting to
            read while still getting its point across. I left the alliteration intentionally,
            and had all three instances of “bond” been included, I likely would have
            included those as well.
        </p>
        <p><b>What have we learned?</b></p>
        <p>
            <b>Morgan:</b> At the outset of this experiment, I’ll admit I had doubts. What
            hope could I, a mere mortal confined to the meatspace, have against
            technology decades in the making? But perhaps my trepidation was
            misguided.
        </p>
        <p>
            This exercise was challenging for a couple of reasons. First, editing
            without context is an inherently difficult task. Without the surrounding
            text—let alone the title of the work being edited—many of the helpful
            (or even necessary) context clues that inform the edit are missing.
            Concerns such as tone, word choice, and logical throughline are much
            harder to nail down, and the editor has to guess at these. And second,
            constant communication with the author is key. Without the ability to
            converse with an author, much of their voice is lost, and the passage
            comes out sounding more like the editor than its original creator. Asking
            questions is as much a part of the job as the editing itself is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, AI cannot reproduce one thing: humanity—that ear for the
            musicality and eye for the nuance of language that a machine can
            only hope to mimic in its cold, unfeeling fashion. This is the stubborn
            advantage of a flesh-and-blood editor, one that I and others in my
            profession won’t cede lightly.
