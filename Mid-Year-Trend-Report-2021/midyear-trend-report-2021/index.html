<p class="text-component">No one would argue that infrastructure is a particularly tantalizing topic. It’s simply a necessity for societies and businesses. Your municipal water system? Glad it works, but unless you’re a water company looking to win a government bid, chances are that system wasn’t on your content radar.  

That might not be the case now, as companies watch thought leadership on infrastructure spill over from technical, niche spaces into mainstream topics of conversation. In the first half of 2021 alone, three major infrastructure-related events generated a lot of buzz:</p>
<p class="text-component">In February, Winter Storm Uri crippled the Texas power grid, leaving millions without power and causing a scarcity of water, food, and heat. The aging electricity grid was just one issue; the uneven distribution of help and resources was another. </p>
<p class="text-component">•</p>
<p class="text-component">We're hoping more companies will put a stake in the ground on how to approach infrastructure with an inclusive, equitable mindset. </p>
<p class="text-component">About a month later, President Joe Biden unveiled a $2 trillion infrastructure plan that redefines the meaning of infrastructure. It’s not just bridges and highways; it’s the care economy, access to digital technology and broadband, and efforts to address climate change. While the agreement between Biden and US senators that’s expected to hit the Senate floor later in July is smaller than the original proposal—$1.2 trillion over eight years, with about $600 billion in new spending—it shows a modern approach to infrastructure that will have massive implications for the workforce, societal norms, education, and jobs. 

In May, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack exposed the vulnerability of infrastructure and how such attacks could be the next big global threat. Hackers already have the ability to shut down water systems, roads, and energy grids, and as infrastructure becomes more tech-driven, those risks will only intensify. </p>

<p class="text-component">No one would argue that infrastructure is a particularly tantalizing topic. It’s simply 
a necessity for societies and businesses. Your municipal water system? Glad it works, but unless you’re a water company looking to win a government bid, 
chances are that system wasn’t on your content radar.  

That might not be the case now, as companies watch thought leadership on infrastructure spill over from technical, niche spaces into mainstream topics of conversation. In the first half of 2021 alone, three major infrastructure-related events generated a lot of buzz:</p>
<p class="text-component">In February, Winter Storm Uri crippled the Texas power grid, leaving millions without power and causing a scarcity of water, food, and heat. The aging electricity grid was just one issue; the uneven distribution of help and resources was another. </p>

<p class="text-component">Just a few years ago, blockchain was heralded as a game-changing technology on par with email. While many of the industry-specific applications have been slower to materialize than anticipated, cryptocurrency and other digital investment products have stepped in to provide a consistent stream of breaking news and, at times, soap opera–style back-and-forth. 

Depending on the week, headlines either reinforce or undermine the legitimacy and staying power of cryptocurrency, often in head-snapping fashion. Bitcoin went from a digital darling in February—when Elon Musk announced that Tesla would accept it for auto purchases—to a digital devil in May when Musk reversed that decision, because of concerns about the environmental toll of cryptocurrency. (He later split the difference, agreeing to accept bitcoin when miners use clean energy.)</p>

Discussions about the future of fiat-based currencies and whether crypto will supplant them raise potentially far-reaching implications. Some large banks, such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, are dipping their toe into the pool, while others have remained on the sidelines. 

To muddy the waters further, NFTs (nonfungible tokens) have arrived on the scene. As a one-of-a-kind digital property, NFTs reside at the intersection of pop culture and speculative investing. Some bands have released new albums as NFTs, Jack Dorsey raised $2.9 million with the sale of his first tweet as an NFT, and the digital artist Beeple set a record with a collage of 5,000 pieces of art for $69 million. People from all corners are seeking to get on the train before it leaves the station—a sign that no one knows whether NFTs are built to last or just the latest fad.</p>

<p class="text-component">It wasn’t long ago that corporate social responsibility and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) initiatives moved from a check-the-box exercise to a foundational element in high-performing companies. By 2019, 93 percent of the world’s largest companies reported on their ESG activities, and investment titans such as BlackRock’s Larry Fink noted that “climate risk is investment risk” in annual letters to shareholders. What’s more, an S&P 500 analysis found that 19 ESG exchange-traded and mutual funds beat out the S&P 500 during the pandemic, further reinforcing the real financial benefits of companies that prioritize ESG activities. </p>
<p class="text-component">Relegating the discussion of ESG to an annual report is a missed opportunity. </p>
<p class="text-component">It’s no wonder, then, that the first half of this year brought a slew of ESG headlines. The Biden administration’s goal of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030 will force many executives to think more expansively about business performance and risk management in relation to sustainability over the long term. 

On the social front, the Black Lives Matter movement and growing recognition of systemic racism spurred companies to champion diversity, equity, and inclusion—within their own walls and beyond. General Motors, for example, upped its commitment to spend 8 percent of its ad budget with Black-owned ad agencies by 2025 (up from 2 percent this year), and JPMorgan Chase announced a $30 billion initiative aimed at closing the racial wealth gap. 

Regarding governance, the notice has been served: activist investors are scrutinizing everything from executive compensation to investment strategies in an effort to ensure companies define success by more than just the bottom line. Executives and boards now recognize that they increasingly will answer for their decisions—and often in public forums.

<p class="text-component">It wasn’t long ago that corporate social responsibility and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) initiatives moved from a check-the-box exercise to a foundational element in high-performing companies. By 2019, 93 percent of the
world’s largest companies reported on their ESG activities, and investment titans such as BlackRock’s Larry Fink noted that “climate risk is investment risk” in annual letters to shareholders. What’s more, an S&P 500 analysis found that 19 ESG exchange-traded and mutual funds beat out the S&P 500 during the pandemic, further reinforcing the real financial benefits of companies that prioritize 
ESG activities. </p>

<p class="text-component">It’s no wonder, then, that the first half of this year brought a slew of ESG headlines. The Biden administration’s goal of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030 will force many executives to think more expansively about business performance and risk management in relation to sustainability over the long term. 

On the social front, the Black Lives Matter movement and growing recognition of systemic racism spurred companies to champion diversity, equity, and inclusion—within their own walls and beyond. General Motors, for example, upped its commitment to spend 8 percent of its ad budget with Black-owned ad agencies by 2025 (up from 2 percent this year), and JPMorgan Chase announced a $30 billion initiative aimed at closing the racial wealth gap. 

Regarding governance, the notice has been served: activist investors are scrutinizing everything from executive compensation to investment strategies in an effort to ensure companies define success by more than just the bottom line. Executives and boards now recognize that they increasingly will answer for their decisions—and often in public forums.

<p class="text-component">Pop quiz: What’s the highest-grossing media of all time in the United States?
A) Star Wars
B) Avatar
C) Grand Theft Auto V

If you answered C, you’re correct. Since its release in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V has raked in more than $6 billion, dwarfing the $3 billion grossed by the original Star Wars and $2.8 billion by Avatar. Today, one out of every three people on the planet is a gamer, and that number is only expected to rise. Part of the appeal comes in the accessibility of gaming; once reserved for middle-class households that could afford $500 consoles, the rise of mobile games, which can be played on cheap smartphones, has made the genre more inclusive. It’s no surprise that China, therefore, is responsible for nearly two-thirds of the entire mobile-gaming market.</p>

The outcome could have significant ramifications on Apple’s app store and payment and distribution of mobile games in general.</p>

<p class="text-component">Even if brands don’t consider gaming a content channel for now, the appeal of gamification is something they should explore. We’ve seen some dynamic examples of simple but engaging games—such as this task-oriented game of navigating office spaces after the pandemic from Reuters or this drag-and-drop election scenario from the New York Times. Even if you don’t get the appeal of Candy Crush, you likely can see how mobile gaming represents a shift in how a large part of the world consumes content. And that shift could be on par with Netflix’s recommendation algorithm or the rise of TikTok—meaning companies should consider doing the following:</p>
<p class="text-component">Pilot a content project that incorporates gamification.

Keep a list of paid media or content that’s worked well when sprinkled into games. 

Reassess your internal content team or vendors to ensure they have editorial, design, and coding skills—or can learn them—so they’ll be ready to bring gamification into the fold.

<p class="text-component">Pop quiz: What’s the highest-grossing media of all time in the U.S.?
A) Star Wars
B) Avatar
C) Grand Theft Auto V

If you answered C, you’re correct. Since its release in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V has raked in more than $6 billion, dwarfing the $3 billion grossed by the original Star Wars and $2.8 billion by Avatar. Today, one out of every three people on the planet are gamers, and that number is only expected to rise. Part of the appeal comes in the accessibility of gaming; once reserved for middle-class households that could afford $500 consoles, the rise of mobile games, which can be played 
on cheap smartphones, has made the 
genre more inclusive. It’s no surprise 
that China, therefore, is responsible for nearly two-thirds of the entire mobile gaming market.</p>

Antitrust watchers and gamers alike are anxiously awaiting the high-profile verdict in Fortnite maker Epic Games’s lawsuit against Apple, which accuses the tech giant of having a monopoly on the way in which revenues from mobile games are processed. The outcome could have significant ramifications on Apple’s app store and payment and distribution of mobile games in general.</p>

We’ve seen some dynamic examples of simple but engaging games—such as this 
task-oriented game of navigating office spaces after the pandemic from Reuters or this drag-and-drop election scenario from the New York Times. Even if you don’t get the appeal of Candy Crush, you likely can see how mobile gaming represents a shift in how a large part of the world consumes content. And that shift could be on par with Netflix’s recommendation algorithm or the rise of TikTok—meaning companies should:anies will put a stake in the ground on actionable guidance and analysis on how to approach infrastructure with an inclusive, equitable mindset.
