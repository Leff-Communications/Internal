So I needed to take a different path.\u201d That\u2019s the best kind of interview answer. \n\nTo get those types of answers it\u2019s critical to do the legwork to first figure out what the audience\u2019s concerns are, and then construct an interview guide that leads the subject down a logical path that tells a good

That\u2019s what makes a Q&A different than any other type of material, so you want to keep as many of their actual words as possible so their voice and their character and their personality come through. But at the same time, an editor\u2019s job here is different than, say, that of a journalist. Our job is to make this person look good and sound smart. \n\nAnd we all speak differently than we write, and we all repeat ourselves when we\u2019re talking, and sometimes there are pauses like I just did a few minutes ago when trying to gather thoughts. And sometimes you ask a question and the interviewee comes back with a great answer to a slightly different question. \n\nIn editing, sometimes you're cutting down a 7,000-word transcript into 1,200 words, so the editor clarifies, simplifies, groups ideas, rewrites questions. And it\u2019s typically just a matter of emphasis. If we mess with the order of the ideas or, say, reformulate a question that wasn\u2019t exactly answered, then it\u2019s more about making sure that the structure accurately reflects what the subject thinks is most important about what they have to say. You give us the raw material and we assemble a

It\u2019s really important from the outset to set expectations, so they know that they can speak freely, it\u2019s OK if they repeat themselves, and if they\u2019re inspired to talk about something that doesn't relate exactly to the question that we asked, we can figure it out afterward. I think it\u2019s good for interviewees to know that they have flexibility.","textSpans":[{"fontColor":"#191919","index":0,"length":9,"letterSpacing":9,"variantGuid":"Uploaded|d596a23d-3d30-11e8-88f3-0e55d9bc9e68"},{"index":9,"length":489,"fontColor":"#191919","letterSpacing":9}],"defaultSpan":{"fontColor":"rgb(0,0,0)","fontSize":20,"variantGuid":"Uploaded|d5969f30-3d30-11e8-88f3-0e55d9bc9e68","underline":false,"letterSpacing":0},"indent":0,"justify":"left","columns":1,"columnGap":0,"leading":32,"textShadow":[],"autoLeading":false,"textTransform":"none","paddingTop":0,"paddingBottom":0,"paddingRight":0,"paddingLeft":0,"showOverflow":true,"justDeletedProperties":false,"glyphMetrics":"[0,0,13.78,,26.76,,40.14,,46.32,,58.5,,71.48,,78.76,,84.54,,90.32,,105.3,,119.12,,127.06,,140.34,,144.52,,156.86,,163.82,,177,,181.18,,190.28,,196,,201.72,,206.42,,212.88,,218.6,,225.56,,237.94,,251.12,,262.02,,267.74,,274.7,,287.08,,300.36,,312.7,,326.34,,338.72,,345.68,,351.4,,358.36,,370.74,,383.92,,388.1,,394.3,,400.02,,407.96,,421.78,,434.96,,448.08,,452.26,,458.72,,462.9,,476.02,,481.74,,498.54,,511.82,,517.88,,531.76,,537.48,,550.6,,562.98,,576.26,,580.44,,593.56,,606.74,,0,32,13.84,,26.22,,40.1,,45.82,,52.28,,56.46,,69.74,,86.54,,92.26,,109.06,,122.24,,128.3,,141.48,,147.2,,155.14,,168.42,,174.14,,187.96,,194.02,,207.2,,220.32,,224.5,,237.78,,250.12,,258.06,,263.78,,270.74,,283.12,,296.96,,303.92,,309.64,,316.6,,328.98,,342.16,,353.06,,358.78,,371.9,,385.18,,397.52,,401.7,,415.58,,427.96,,435.16,,442.12,,447.84,,454.3,,458.48,,468.26,,473.98,,487.82,,500.2,,511.1,,518.06,,530.44,,534.62,,547,,560.64,,0,64,13.84,,20.5,,27.46,,40.64,,46.84,,67.02,,73.98,,86.36,,100.2,,107.16,,114.36,,122.3,,128.02,,141.86,,147.58,,151.76,,165.04,,172,,177.72,,191,,197.46,,203.18,,217,,223.06,,236.24,,244.18,,252.12,,264.46,,270.52,,283.7,,289.42,,295.14,,299.84,,306.8,,314,,321.94,,327.66,,333.72,,346.9,,360.74,,364.92,,369.1,,380,,385.72,,389.9,,408.84,,422.66,,435.94,,442.14,,449.1,,462.94,,475.32,,482.28,,488,,494.46,,500.52,,513.8,,532.74,,538.46,,545.42,,557.8,,570.98,,576.7,,589.98,,602.32,,609.28,,617.22,,630.4,,637.36,,0,96,6.96,,20.24,,25.96,,33.9,,47.08,,54.04,,59.76,,72.94,,82.72,,96.54,,109.72,,122.84,,129.8,,143.64,,150.6,,154.78,,168.06,,180.44,,188.38,,194.1,,199.82,,207.76,,221.04,,226.76,,233.72,,246.1,,259.28,,270.18,,275.9,,286.12,,298.5,,311.78,,328.58,,334.3,,341.26,,353.64,,367.48,,374.44,,380.16,,387.12,,399.5,,412.68,,423.58,,429.3,,442.42,,456.26,,468.64,,474.36,,482.3,,496.12,,509.3,,523.14,,533.36,,539.08,,545.54,,551.6,,564.78,,577.96,,582.14,,593.04,,598.76,,604.48,,608.66,,615.62,,622.82,,630.76,,0,128,17.56,,29.56,,35.28,,39.46,,45.92,,51.64,,58.6,,70.98,,84.16,,95.06,,100.78,,106.84,,120.02,,133.84,,147.02,,160.86,,167.82,,173.54,,180.5,,192.88,,206.06,,225,,232.94,,246.12,,250.3,,261.56,,274.74,,282.68,,288.4,,294.12,,307.96,,320.34,,334.22,,339.94,,344.12,,350.58,,356.3,,363.26,,375.64,,388.82,,399.72,,406.92,,412.98,,426.16,,431.88,,436.06,,448.44,,456.38,,470.2,,474.38,,480.44,,493.62,,507.5,,513.22,,520.18,,533.46,,539.18,,546.14,,559.98,,564.16,,574.38,,580.1,,593.94,,607.76,,621.04,,633.38,,640.34,,0,160,7.94,,21.22,,40.16,,53.34,,60.3,,72.68,,76.86,,89.24,,102.88,,108.6,,115.56,,127.94,,141.78,,148.74,,154.46,,168.34,,181.62,,194.8,,202.74,,215.12,,219.76,,226.72,,232.44,,238.5,,251.68,,255.86,,269.7,,276.66,,289.84,,295.56,,308.74,,318.52,,332.36,,345.48,,352.44,,356.62,,367.52,,373.24,,380.2,,393.48,,399.2,,406.16,,418.54,,431.72,,437.44,,451.26,,463.6,,476.78,,484.72,,491.68,,495.86,,509.14,,521.52,,527.24,,534.2,,546.58,,560.42,,567.38,,573.1,,589.9,,603.08,,0,192,13.84,,21.78,,31.6,,44.78,,58.66,,64.38,,70.1,,86.9,,100.08,,105.8,,118.92,,132.76,,145.14,,150.86,,157.32,,161.5,,175.14,,187.48,,193.54,,206.72,,212.44,,216.62,,223.58,,229.3,,242.58,,254.92,,261.88,,267.6,,281.44,,288.1,,295.06,,308.24,,314.44,,331.24,,345.08,,351.14,,365.02,,370.74,,376.46,,381.16,,386.88,,393.84,,406.22,,410.4,,422.78,,433,,438.72,,442.9,,449.86,,457.06,,465,,470.72,,484.36,,497.64,,510.92,,524.8,,530.52,,536.98,,550.26,,556.46,,0,224,4.18,,16.56,,23.52,,36.7,,42.9,,54.16,,58.34,,71.52,,88.32,,101.5,,114.68,,122.62,,128.34,,135.3,,148.58,,154.3,,164.52,,176.9,,190.18,,206.98,,212.7,,219.66,,232.04,,245.88,,252.84,,258.56,,265.52,,277.9,,291.08,,301.98,,307.7,,320.08,,333.92,,345.18,,358.36,,364.08,,370.54,,374.72,,387.9,,397.68,,401.86,,415.68,,419.86,,424.04,,428.22,,435.18,,444.28,,450,]","fixedPosition":false,"backgroundHasBeenSet":false,"showHoverCursor":false,"synced":false,"overrides":[],"htmlTag":"p"},"5de6998baf2e3":{"title":"Check.png","progress":null,"type":"image-component","x":44,"y":4643,"width":78,"height":78,"contentType":"image\/png","border":{"radius":0},"id":"5de6998baf2e3","fixedPosition":false,"preserveAspectRatio":true,"opacity":1,"rotation":0,"visible":true,"locked":false,"background":[],"backgroundHasBeenSet":false,"animations":[{"duration":0.8,"delay":0.2,"easing":"ease","type":"enlargeFadeIn"}],"exitAnimations":[],"interactions":[],"shadow":{"color":"#

Well, that\u2019s obviously not optimal because one of \nthe purposes of doing a Q&A is that people speak differently than they write. They tend to be much more expressive when they\u2019re talking rather than writing. Written Q&As tend to be \nmore generic\u2014and in business, often littered with dense \njargon. And it\u2019s even harder to capture the interviewee\u2019s \nvoice and experience and perspective if someone on their communications team or something is filling out the questions for them. In the worst-case scenario, it ends up being overtly promotional, which of course you want to avoid at all costs because you want readers to feel like they\u2019re getting something valuable without anything expected in return. Thought leadership shouldn\u2019t be a sales pitch.

It\u2019s pretty straightforward: you learn as much as you can about the interview subject, write an interview guide, conduct \nthe interview, edit the transcript, and then send it to the interviewee for approval. Sometimes the editor conducts the interview, and sometimes a consultant or other subject matter expert conducts \nthe interview. \n\nIn my experience, you get the best results when both the editor and the subject matter expert are present, and the editor is involved from the very beginning in writing the interview guide.
