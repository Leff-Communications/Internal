success.","textSpans":[{"index":0,"length":960,"letterSpacing":10}],"defaultSpan":{"fontColor":"#000000","fontSize":25,"variantGuid":"Uploaded|d5969f30-3d30-11e8-88f3-0e55d9bc9e68","underline":false,"letterSpacing":0},"indent":0,"justify":"left","columns":1,"columnGap":0,"leading":30,"textShadow":[],"autoLeading":false,"textTransform":"none","paddingTop":0,"paddingBottom":0,"paddingRight":0,"paddingLeft":0,"showOverflow":true,"justDeletedProperties":false,"glyphMetrics":"[0,0,21.98,,37.48,,53.98,,61.15,,77.78,,85.88,,93.05,,101.77,,117.27,,133.77,,140.95,,158.25,,175.57,,185.52,,190.77,,207.2,,214.38,,223.1,,239.6,,255.1,,271.6,,280.33,,290.28,,297.45,,314.08,,322.18,,329.35,,345.78,,353.55,,358.8,,368.75,,374,,383.95,,391.13,,407.55,,424.18,,447.88,,471.58,,487.03,,502.53,,507.78,,524.2,,541.53,,550.25,,555.5,,572.13,,587.63,,597.58,,604.75,,610,,619.95,,627.13,,639.93,,645.18,,653.28,,660.45,,674.1,,690.73,,706.18,,713.35,,729.77,,747.1,,762.6,,771.63,,780.35,,0,30,16.5,,32,,49.38,,56.55,,73.88,,81.05,,91,,96.25,,104.97,,120.42,,137.75,,146.47,,151.72,,168.35,,183.85,,191.03,,200.97,,218.3,,227.02,,232.27,,242.22,,250.32,,267.65,,284.07,,292.8,,309.43,,317.2,,322.45,,327.7,,341.35,,348.52,,355.7,,373.07,,389.7,,396.88,,414.2,,419.45,,424.7,,431.88,,445.52,,462.15,,477.6,,484.77,,501.2,,518.52,,534.02,,541.2,,549.92,,566.55,,573.72,,590.22,,605.72,,623.1,,630.27,,635.52,,644.25,,651.42,,668.72,,684.17,,689.42,,705.85,,718.65,,723.9,,735.3,,742.47,,754.82,,0,60,10.9,,26.4,,42.9,,50.08,,58.8,,66.4,,83.03,,98.48,,115.78,,121.03,,137.53,,144.7,,149.95,,159.9,,167.08,,174.25,,195.28,,200.53,,209.25,,224.75,,231.93,,240.65,,256.15,,261.4,,271.35,,278.53,,295.83,,313.15,,328.65,,346.03,,362.53,,386.23,,391.48,,407.9,,415.08,,422.25,,430.98,,446.48,,462.98,,470.15,,487.45,,495.05,,511.68,,521.63,,538.93,,555.43,,571.85,,580.58,,587.75,,595.85,,612.48,,620.25,,627.42,,644.75,,660.25,,667.42,,683.92,,699.42,,716.8,,723.97,,741.35,,758.67,,767.4,,783.9,,0,90,5.25,,15.2,,22.38,,32.33,,41.05,,46.3,,51.55,,56.8,,63.98,,73.93,,90.55,,97.73,,105.33,,121.83,,145.53,,162.15,,170.88,,187.38,,194.55,,203.28,,218.78,,236.1,,244.82,,252,,260.73,,276.23,,281.48,,291.43,,298.6,,306.7,,314.3,,331.63,,355.33,,371.83,,392.85,,409.48,,417.98,,430.78,,437.95,,443.28,,458.73,,468.68,,477.4,,484.58,,501.95,,518.58,,535.08,,545.03,,560.53,,569.55,,578.28,,585.45,,606.48,,623.1,,631.6,,644.4,,651.57,,668.9,,684.4,,698.05,,705.22,,710.47,,727.1,,742.6,,759.67,,776.17,,782.13,,789.3,,0,120,13.2,,29.83,,37,,44.17,,65.2,,70.45,,79.17,,94.67,,101.85,,110.57,,126.07,,143.4,,152.12,,159.3,,164.55,,180.05,,187.22,,210.93,,216.18,,231.68,,249.05,,256.23,,263.4,,279.83,,296.45,,320.15,,337.45,,354.78,,370.28,,375.53,,392.03,,401.98,,409.15,,416.33,,421.58,,430.05,,437.65,,454.15,,464.1,,481.4,,497.9,,514.33,,523.05,,528.3,,542.4,,558.9,,566.08,,582.7,,590.8,,597.98,,606.7,,622.2,,638.7,,643.95,,651.73,,658.9,,668.85,,674.1,,684.98,,701.48,,708.65,,725.27,,733.05,,0,150,21.03,,36.53,,53.03,,61.75,,77.25,,93.75,,101.53,,108.7,,117.42,,132.93,,149.43,,163.08,,170.25,,187.58,,195.18,,211.68,,218.85,,236.15,,251.6,,268.9,,274.15,,279.4,,295.83,,303,,319.63,,327.4,,334.58,,351.88,,359.65,,364.9,,379,,396.33,,405.05,,421.55,,428.73,,435.9,,451.4,,467.9,,484.4,,501.78,,508.95,,517.68,,534.3,,541.48,,558.8,,576.18,,592.8,,610.1,,618.83,,626,,643.33,,650.5,,666,,682.5,,703.52,,0,180,23.7,,40.33,,57.7,,74.2,,79.45,,104.7,,121.33,,136.82,,153.32,,160.5,,169.22,,184.72,,202.05,,210.77,,219.8,,229.75,,236.92,,260.63,,277.25,,284.85,,301.35,,308.53,,318.48,,327.2,,334.8,,352.13,,360.85,,377.35,,394.43,,399.68,,416.1,,423.28,,440.6,,456.1,,473.48,,480.65,,489.38,,506.7,,519,,535.5,,545.45,,552.63,,561.35,,576.85,,593.35,,600.53,,605.78,,622.4,,637.9,,654.98,,662.15,,676.25,,681.5,,698,,716.78,,723.95,,0,210,7.18,,0,240,9.6,,26.23,,33.4,,49.9,,58.08,,66.18,,82.68,,99.1,,107.83,,113.08,,127.18,,143.68,,148.93,,162.58,,169.75,,187.05,,202.5,,219,,224.25,,229.5,,236.68,,245.4,,260.9,,277.4,,284.58,,301.9,,317.4,,329.65,,334.9,,351.4,,360.13,,373.78,,380.95,,389.68,,405.18,,422.5,,431.23,,438.4,,455.73,,460.98,,466.23,,473.4,,483.35,,492.08,,509.4,,521.7,,538.2,,553.7,,570.33,,575.58,,592.95,,609.45,,617.23,,627.18,,634.35,,642.45,,658.95,,675.45,,680.7,,687.88,,696.6,,713.23,,730.6,,747.93,,761.58,,768.75,,0,270,16.63,,24.23,,41.3,,58.63,,74.13,,79.38,,90.25,,107.58,,116.3,,121.55,,138.18,,153.68,,163.63,,170.8,,191.83,,197.08,,202.33,,207.58,,214.75,,232.05,,248.55,,255.73,,276.75,,293.25,,298.5,,303.75,,310.93,,320.88,,337.38,,345.15,,359.25,,375.75,,393.13,,400.3,,409.03,,425.65,,432.83,,449.25,,465.88,,489.58,,513.28,,528.73,,544.23,,549.48,,565.9,,583.23,,591.95,,608.45,,615.63,,632.13,,649.45,,657.95,,663.2,,676.85,,684.03,,701.35,,716.85,,734.23,,0,300,16.63,,24.98,,33.7,,50.2,,65.7,,72.88,,80.05,,85.95,,101.45,,118.83,,135.32,,151.82,,169.2,,176.38,,183.55,,192.28,,207.78,,224.28,,231.45,,248.78,,265.2,,273.93,,281.1,,297.73,,305.83,,313,,329.43,,346.05,,369.7

so.","textSpans":[{"index":0,"length":746,"letterSpacing":10}],"defaultSpan":{"fontColor":"#000000","fontSize":25,"variantGuid":"Uploaded|d5969f30-3d30-11e8-88f3-0e55d9bc9e68","underline":false,"letterSpacing":0},"indent":0,"justify":"left","columns":1,"columnGap":0,"leading":30,"textShadow":[],"autoLeading":false,"textTransform":"none","paddingTop":0,"paddingBottom":0,"paddingRight":0,"paddingLeft":0,"showOverflow":true,"justDeletedProperties":false,"glyphMetrics":"[0,0,5.9,,21.4,,28.57,,52.28,,69.6,,85.1,,98.75,,105.93,,126.95,,144.28,,157.93,,167.88,,175.05,,182.23,,190.95,,206.45,,222.95,,230.13,,246.63,,260.73,,277.35,,282.6,,298.05,,306.78,,312.03,,328.65,,344.15,,351.33,,367.95,,376.05,,383.23,,399.65,,416.28,,424.05,,441.35,,457.98,,465.58,,482.9,,491.63,,508.13,,515.3,,539,,555.5,,565.45,,575.4,,592.73,,609.8,,615.05,,630.55,,647.63,,654.8,,671.43,,685.53,,702.03,,709.8,,716.98,,725.7,,741.2,,757.7,,0,30,17.3,,34.63,,44.58,,53.3,,60.48,,68.58,,73.83,,87.93,,104.43,,111.6,,120.33,,136.95,,144.13,,154.07,,159.32,,171.57,,178.75,,202.45,,219.07,,234.57,,243.3,,258.8,,268.75,,275.92,,291.42,,308.75,,318.7,,325.87,,343.17,,360.5,,368.1,,385.42,,390.67,,395.92,,412.42,,417.67,,434.17,,451.55,,458.72,,467.45,,482.95,,499.45,,506.63,,511.88,,527.38,,543.8,,551.4,,567.9,,585.23,,595.18,,611.68,,629.05,,636.23,,646.18,,662.6,,667.85,,684.35,,699.85,,708.58,,713.83,,721.93,,727.18,,743.6,,0,60,17.32,,32.83,,50.2,,57.38,,81.08,,97.58,,114.95,,120.2,,136.63,,153.95,,159.2,,166.38,,181.82,,197.32,,214.7,,231.2,,238.97,,248.92,,257.65,,274.97,,290.47,,307.85,,313.1,,328.6,,345.67,,352.85,,369.47,,377.57,,384.75,,393.48,,408.98,,425.48,,432.65,,453.23,,475.2,,493,,498.9,,517.75,,526.3,,540.4,,554.5,,561.67,,575.77,,581.02,,588.8,,604.25,,614.2,,621.38,,626.63,,635.35,,645.3,,661.8,,667.05,,675.15,,682.33,,689.5,,707.38,,716.1,,723.27,,732,,747.5,,764,,0,90,16.63,,32.08,,40.8,,50.75,,67.25,,75.97,,83.15,,90.32,,106.75,,123.37,,147.07,,164.38,,181.7,,197.2,,202.45,,218.95,,228.9,,236.07,,244.8,,261.3,,276.8,,294.17,,310.67,,328.05,,335.22,,343.95,,360.57,,367.75,,376.48,,381.73,,399.03,,407.75,,424.38,,440.88,,448.05,,456.78,,472.28,,479.88,,496.5,,511.95,,529.03,,544.53,,551.7,,560.43,,575.93,,592.43,,597.68,,605.45,,612.63,,636.33,,652.83,,662.78,,672.73,,690.05,,707.13,,712.38,,727.88,,744.95,,0,120,17.32,,32.83,,50.2,,57.38,,64.55,,85.58,,101.08,,117.58,,125.17,,141.68,,155.78,,172.28,,180.05,,187.23,,204.53,,221.15,,231.1,,241.05,,246.3,,263.6,,268.85,,285.35,,292.53,,299.7,,317.03,,331.13,,347.75,,353,,370.38,,377.55,,386.28,,401.78,,418.28,,425.45,,434.18,,450.8,,466.25,,483.33,,498.83,,506,,523.3,,538.75,,555.25,,565.2,,573.93,,579.18,,595.8,,611.3,,621.25,,628.43,,635.6,,651.1,,667.73,,685.03,,690.28,,705.78,,722.85,,730.03,,738.75,,754.25,,771.58,,780.3,,0,150,8.72,,24.23,,40.73,,47.9,,64.33,,72.1,,77.35,,87.3,,92.55,,102.5,,109.68,,130.7,,147.33,,162.78,,168.03,,185.4,,192.58,,209.9,,227.2,,244.53,,253.25,,269.75,,276.93,,284.1,,302.85,,318.35,,335.73,,342.9,,351.63,,367.13,,384.45,,393.18,,400.35,,421.38,,438,,446.5,,458.8,,475.3,,492.68,,499.85,,507.03,,515.13,,531.75,,539.53,,546.7,,564.03,,571.2,,581.15,,596.65,,613.28,,621.05,,629.78,,636.95,,645.68,,650.93,,674.63,,691.13,,698.3,,705.48,,724.23,,740.73,,752.98,,761.7,,768.88,,0,180,16.43,,33.75,,57.45,,73.95,,81.13,,98.45,,113.95,,121.13,,137.63,,161.32,,177.95,,186.67,,191.92,,208.55,,224.05,,241.37,,246.62,,253.8,,261.4,,277.9,,287.85,,305.15,,321.77,,337.27,,347.22,,363.72,,370.9,,379.63,,395.13,,412.45,,421.18,,428.35,,438.3,,453.75,,477.45,,501.15,,517.77,,533.27,,549.77,,567.15,,574.32,,591.65,,598.82,,622.52,,639.15,,646.75,,663.25,,670.42,,687.72,,704.35,,714.3,,719.55,,728.27,,733.52,,747.63,,764.13,,0,210,8.72,,25.35,,40.85,,57.35,,64.53,,81.85,,97.35,,114.73,,121.9,,139.22,,146.4,,162.83,,179.45,,184.7,,189.95,,206.45,,222.88,,231.6,,236.85,,250.95,,267.45,,274.63,,291.05,,307.68,,331.38,,355.08,,360.33,,369.05,,392.75,,409.25,,424.75,,433.48,,440.65,,449.38,,466,,473.18,,494.2,,510.83,,519.33,,532.13,,539.3,,548.02,,564.65,,581.73,,598.23,,606.95,,622.45,,638.95,,646.73,,653.9,,662.63,,679.25,,0,240,16.63,,30.73,,47.23,,54.83,,71.25,,87.88,,111.58,,128.07,,135.25,,143.97,,159.47,,175.97,,183.15,,199.58,,215.08,,232.4,,237.65,,242.9,,259.4,,274.9,,291.97,,308.47,,318.42,,325.6,,342.92,,351.65,,358.82,,374.32,,391.65,,407.15,,424.52,,431.7,,438.88,,449.77,,465.27,,482.6,,491.32,,498.5,,514,,531.33,,541.28,,548.45,,565.75,,582.25,,598.75,,614.25,,621.42,,629.52,,646.15,,651.4,,656.65,,673.27,,694.3,,710.8,,728.17,,735.35,,752.65,,766.3,,773.47,,790.8,,0,270,23.7,,39.15,,55.58,,71.08,,78.25,,101.95,,118.58,,126.17,,142.68,,149.85,,157.45,,173.95,,191.28,,196.53,,201.78,,211.72,,220.45,,225.7,,242.13,,249.3,,273,,289.5,,299.45,,309.4,,326.72,,343.8,,349.05,,364.55,,381.62,,388.8,,406.12,,413.72,,430.15,,445.65,,450.9,,459.63,,476.13,,492.55,,501.28,,516.73,,524.33,,540.83,,548,,556.73,,572.23,,589.55,,598.28,,605.45,,620.9,,636.4,,653.78,,670

best practices for crisis communications\n\n\nIdeally, in the event of a crisis, a company would access its crisis communications playbook, turn to the appropriate section, and execute the plan outlined therein. Sadly, that occurs infrequently at best. Instead, most organizations begin behind the eight ball and struggle to play catch up.\n\nStrategically, it\u2019s often helpful to see a crisis situation through the villain-victim-vindicator prism. In this construct, the company has the opportunity\u2014if it moves quickly\u2014to avoid being positioned as the bad actor, and instead be seen as working hard to lead the organization and solve the underlying problems at hand.\n\nTactically, the approach to successfully managing crisis communications includes a number of steps:\n\n\u2022Establish a select team of senior managers drawn from across     the enterprise who are empowered to act decisively on the       company\u2019s behalf to manage the crisis. We often refer to this     group as the CAT\u2014Crisis Action Team.\n\n\u2022Create workable protocols to ensure that the necessary               information flows up to the CAT  and that its decisions are then   executed with dispatch. \n\n\u2022Assess the organization\u2019s vulnerabilities and map response           steps, along with all appropriate materials, to each one.\n\n\u2022Monitor traditional and social media in real time and correct     all errors immediately, lest they become accepted as fact and   repeated.\n\n\u2022Look horizontally inside the company to make sure that               otherwise innocuous commentary, events, and regulatory           filings are not taken out of context. For example, the risks             section of a company\u2019s 10-Q, which is authored by the legal       team, often contains the widest possible articulation of               potential risks to the company, as it should.

Clearly, its business was among the hardest hit, especially during what amounted to a national quarantine. It recognized the obvious and didn\u2019t pretend it wasn\u2019t an issue. Instead, it ran to the crisis and talked specifically about its severe impact on employees at its hotels around the world.  The company demonstrated leadership with a pledge by CEO Arne Sorenson and Board Chairman Bill Marriott that they would be giving up their salaries for a period of time, that the company\u2019s executive team would take a 50 percent salary cut, and that two-thirds of its 4,000 corporate employees at the company\u2019s Bethesda, Maryland, headquarters would be furloughed (so that they could retain their benefits, including healthcare).\n\nNext, they proactively created the Marriott Cleanliness Council, a group of in-house and outside experts in food and water safety, hygiene and infection prevention, and hotel operations to develop a new generation of global hospitality cleanliness standards, norms, and behaviors.\n\nOf course, all corporate promises need to be kept\u2014in actuality as well as in perception. Those who make big promises and then use some sleight of hand to retain their compensation later will be held accountable.

In fact, it\u2019s more important than ever. The last thing any organization wants is to be defined to new audiences \nby a stumble. Instead, companies that have invested the time and effort to build a sturdy reputation are far better positioned to withstand potential criticism, deserved or not. Think of it this way: one of the goals of thought leadership is to create a moment of pause for people so that when they hear about \nor read about an organization in crisis, they will say to themselves, \u201cthat\u2019s not the company that I know.\u201d The continuation of thought leadership also sends an important foundational message that the company, and especially its leadership team, is not paralyzed and remains focused on running the business and driving it forward.
